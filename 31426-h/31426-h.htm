<h1>EAGLES OF THE SKY</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>READY FOR BUSINESS</span></h2>

<p>When the &#8220;Big Boss&#8221; at Secret Service Headquarters in Washington
sent Jack Ralston and his pal, Gabe Perkiser, to Florida with orders to comb the
entire Gulf Coast from the Ten Thousand Islands as far north as Pensacola and
break up the defiant league of smugglers, great and small, that had for so long
been playing a game of hide-and-seek with the Coast Guard revenue officers, the
task thus assigned was particularly to the liking of those two bold and
dependable sky detectives.</p>

<p>They loved nothing better than <i>action</i>&#8211;never felt entirely happy
unless matching their wits against those of skulking law breakers&#8211;while to
sup with danger, and run across all manner of thrilling adventures&#8211;that
was a daily yearning with them.</p>

<p>Since so much of their work must of necessity take them over that vast
stretch of salt water <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_14'></a>14</span> lying between the Florida coast and the far distant
Mexican shore line, the wise men in Washington had supplied Jack with a speedy
plane of the amphibian type, capable of making landings either on shore or in
any of the numerous inlets dotting the coast, it being equipped with both
aluminum pontoons and adjustable wheels.</p>

<p>Jack had spent several days at the Capital, conferring with various high
officials, being thus put in possession of every available scrap of reliable
information at the disposal of the Department.</p>

<p>He had also been given documents of authority, calling upon each and every
Government agent in all Florida to afford him any possible assistance, should he
require such backing while learning the identity of the &#8220;higher-up&#8221;
capitalists guilty of financing the secret clique that had been giving the
revenue men such trouble recently.</p>

<p>The fact was well known that besides the valuable <i>caches</i> of unset
diamonds, and other precious stones, coming surreptitiously into the country
without yielding the customary heavy duty imposed on them, there was also being
smuggled into the innumerable lonely bayous and inlets of the lengthy coast line
vast quantities of contraband in violation of the eighteenth amendment, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span> also batches of
undesirable aliens like Chinese, anarchists and Bolsheviks, such riffraff as
Uncle Sam had been holding off under a strict ban.</p>

<p>So, too, it was understood that besides the fleet of swift, small power-boats
employed night after night in this profitable game of mocking the Treasury
Department, latterly the smugglers had been freighting their cargoes by means of
airplanes that would be able to land the contraband stuff in lonely places far
back of the low coast sections.</p>

<p>It was therefore a monumental task, covering a wide field of operation and
with constant peril hovering over the heads of the two adventurous aviators who
had undertaken so joyously to spread the net and draw its meshes about the
offenders.</p>

<p>Their preparations having been completed, they were waiting in an isolated
little bayou surrounded by inaccessible swamps and mangrove islands ready to
take off with the coming of the friendly shades of night.</p>

<p>To those who enjoyed reading the preceding volume of this series of aviation
adventures, where Jack and &#8220;Perk,&#8221; in order to get their
man&#8211;one of the boldest and most successful counterfeiters known in the
annals of crime&#8211;found it necessary to fly across the Mexican <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span> boundary line and snatch
their victim out of an extinct volcano crater that had once been the fort of the
fierce Yaqui Indian tribe,<a id='FNanchor_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1'
class='fnanchor'><sup>[1]</sup></a> will think it a rather far cry for the Sky
Detectives to be detailed to active duty some thousands of miles distant, and in
the extreme southeastern corner of the republic.</p>

<p>So it always must be with the famous Secret Service men&#8211;their motto,
like that of our present day Boy Scouts, is &#8220;Be Prepared&#8221;; for day
and night they must hold themselves in readiness to start to the other side of
the world if necessary&#8211;China, Japan, India, the Philippines
perhaps&#8211;detailed to fetch back some notorious malefactor wanted by Uncle
Sam, and information of whose presence in distant lands has reached
Headquarters.</p>

<p>As a rule it was Perk&#8217;s duty to see that their flying ship was well
stocked with all necessary supplies, from liquid fuel and lubricating oil down
to such food stores as they would require, even if forced to remain for days, or
a week, without connections along the line of groceries and commissary
stuff.</p>

<p>Perk himself was an odd mixture of New England and Canuck blood, one branch
of his family living in Maine, while the other resided across the border. Hence
Perk sometimes chose <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
to call himself a Yankee; and yet for a period of several years he had been a
valued member of the Northwestern Mounted Police, doing all manner of desperate
stunts up in the cold regions of Canada.</p>

<p>He was considerably older than his gifted chum and had seen pretty hot
service flying in France while with Pershing&#8217;s army in the Argonne. It was
his knowledge of aviation in general that had caused Jack to pick him as his
assistant when the Government decided to fight fire with fire, by pitting their
own pilots and aircraft against those employed by the powerful combine of
smuggling aces.</p>

<p>Sometimes it chanced that Jack, for good and sufficient reasons of his own,
did not fully explain the necessity for making plans along certain lines.</p>

<p>This was not because he lacked confidence in his loquacious chum&#8217;s
ability to keep a still tongue in his head or exercise due caution, but usually
through a desire to make doubly sure of his own ground before submitting the
arrangement to Perk&#8217;s sharp criticism, which Jack valued even more than
the other suspected.</p>

<p>Consequently Perk, with the Yankee half of his blood stirred by an ever
present curiosity, wanted to know and invariably asked numerous <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span> questions in the endeavor
to find a leading clue.</p>

<p>It was in the late Fall and already the advance guard of the winter tourist
crowds had begun to arrive from the North, in ever increasing numbers, all set
for an enjoyable winter in the sunny resorts of both coasts.</p>

<p>Jack had already made quite a thorough investigation and picked up some
important clues that he meant to run down in hopes one of them might lead to
definite results.</p>

<p>The amphibian floated on the surface of the isolated bayou with glimpses of
the open gulf toward the golden west forming an alluring picture as seen between
the jaws of sand points, with palmettoes guarding the entrance to the sheltered
nook.</p>

<p>It was just sunset, and inside another hour the night would have advanced far
enough to permit their departure on the first leg of their intended flight up
the coast.</p>

<p>Perk was exceedingly fond of his pipe and choice tobacco, and looked the
picture of contentment as he squatted in his seat, scratching his ankle, where a
burning sensation told him he had once again been visited by the tiny but
venomous red-bug pest which he hated with all his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drat the little beggars,&#8221; he was muttering as he kept on digging
at his leg, &#8220;they sure do beat <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_19'></a>19</span> anything I ever run acrost in all my
wanderin&#8217;s. It ain&#8217;t so bad to be slappin&#8217; at pesky skeeters,
&#8217;cause I&#8217;m used to sich bloodsuckers; but sandflies, and&#8217; jiggers,
an&#8217; redbugs make a combination that&#8217;d be hard to beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try that kerosene again, brother,&#8221; advised Jack, who somehow
seemed to be a favored one, since he was immune from similar attacks, and
greatly envied on that account by his unlucky; pal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221; growled the usually good tempered Perk, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
rubbed that on, an&#8217; witch hazel, an&#8217; all sorts o&#8217; lotions till
I guess now I smell like a stick-pot set out, with old rags smoulderin&#8217; to
keep the skeets away. Salt water helps a mite, but this scratchin&#8217; which I
just can&#8217;t let up on to save my life, makes things worse right
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon he kicked off his shoes, removed his socks, and thrust both feet
over the side to dabble them in the saline water of the lagoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep an eye out for that big &#8217;gator we scared off the bank a while
back,&#8221; warned Jack, wickedly, &#8220;he might think it was a wild duck
splashing, and try to pot it for his supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! mebbe now that&#8217;s about the only way to get relief&#8211;let
him snap the foot off an&#8217; it won&#8217;t itch me any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite this reckless assertion Perk quickly ceased his
splashing and resumed <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_20'></a>20</span> his footgear, heroically refraining from rubbing the
affected parts. After a short interval of staring at the glowing heavens, as if
the sight fairly fascinated him, Perk again spoke, this time finding something
of more importance than insect bites to talk about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall,&#8221; he drawled in his customary slow fashion,
&#8220;here&#8217;s hopin&#8217; we ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to be knocked out
in our calculations tonight, but get a line on what the boys are doin&#8217; up
the coast, eh, partner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t be our fault if we don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jack, who
doubtless recognized from the signs that his mate had something in his mind,
which he meant to spring on him by cautious insinuations and half questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;A right decent crate that was we saw pass over early this morning
I&#8217;d say, old hoss,&#8221; continued Perk, nodding his head as if to
punctuate his remarks and also to cause his thoughts to flow more smoothly.
&#8220;I had a good peep at it as we lay behind that bunch o&#8217; saw palmetto
out front, an&#8217; unless I&#8217;m away off in my guess, she was a
Curtiss-Robin ship&#8211;a big crate in the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They need them big in their line of business,&#8221; Jack went on
significantly. &#8220;A full cargo of wet goods is pretty heavy, you know,
Perk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>&#8220;You said
it, partner,&#8221; assented the other, grinning amiably and yet with a shade of
Yankee cunning. &#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;s more to the p&#8217;int the guy
handlin&#8217; the stick was no slouch at his job, b&#8217;lieve me. I wonder now
could he have been that Oscar Gleeb we been hearin&#8217; so much about since
comin&#8217; down here,&#8211;got an idea he might abeen, ain&#8217;t you,
Boss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as like as not,&#8221; Jack told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Some go as far as to say he used to be a Boche pilot in that fuss
across the big water,&#8221; continued Perk, reflectively, as though certain
memories of the long-ago had awakened in his brain&#8211;recollections that
breathed of action, staccato machine-gun fire, exploding shells, and the
terrible odor of gas that had poisoned so many of his former mates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they said there wasn&#8217;t any doubt about that,&#8221; Jack
asserted. &#8220;After the war was over and he couldn&#8217;t find work in his
home country, he managed to get to America and has cut quite a figure in flying
circles. I reckon he was tempted by the big money in the smuggling game to take
a job with this combine along the coast and has been fetching heaps of cargoes
ashore from vessels anchored far out on the gulf, or even across from Bimini or
Santa Fe Beach near Havana over in Cuba.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By jinks!&#8221; ejaculated Perk, &#8220;that there&#8217;s the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span> place we learned they was
shippin&#8217; Chinks over to Florida from, ain&#8217;t it Jack, boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what it was,&#8221; admitted the other. &#8220;It seems that this
big combine, made up of rich American sporting men, with a mixture of Cubans and
adventurers from all nations, doubles up in crashing Uncle Sam&#8217;s coast
gates with aliens, as well as hard stuff in bottles and barrels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, I&#8217;m jest awonderin&#8217;?&#8221; continued Perk,
&#8220;whether it could a&#8217;happened that this same Oscar Gleeb an&#8217; me ever
hit it up and had an air duel tryin&#8217; to strafe each other when
flyin&#8217; across No-Man&#8217;s-Land over there. Kinder like to meet up with
him so we could run over our scraps an&#8217; see if one o&#8217; us sent
t&#8217;other down in a blazin&#8217; coffin. It&#8217;d be funny if it turned out
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer things do happen sometimes,&#8221; agreed Jack, yawning.
&#8220;This warm day&#8217;s made me feel a bit lazy but as soon as we get a
move on all that will slip away like fog under the morning sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, partner, how &#8217;bout that Greek sponger we talked with when
we dropped in at Tarpon Springs t&#8217;other day&#8211;you kinder s&#8217;pected he knew a
heap more about these goin&#8217;s-on than he wanted us to grab, even if we was
jest s&#8217;posed to be Northern tourists, bent on havin&#8217; a fishin&#8217; spree
later on when big tarpon strike in around <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_23'></a>23</span> Fort Myers&#8211;could them spongers have a hand
afetchin&#8217; in bottled stuff, or ferryin&#8217; Chinks over from some island
halfway point?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some folks seem to think that possible,&#8221; he was told.
&#8220;After looking over the ground, and getting the opinion of a heap of
people who ought to have an intelligent opinion covering the facts known and
suspected, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that if ever there was a time when
you could play safe by suspecting everybody you met of having some sort of money
interest in this big game, it&#8217;s down along the Florida west coast and like
as not over toward Miami just the same. I&#8217;m not trusting my secrets to a
living soul, saving a few Government agents to whom I&#8217;ve been directed by
my superiors&#8211;and I&#8217;m even a bit leery about some of that
bunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah! From this time on seems to me we&#8217;d be wise to play a lone
hand, an&#8217; not bother about takin&#8217; any gyps into our confidence, eh
what, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never said truer words, my boy,&#8221; assented the other, smiling
as he noted the look of pleasure flashing across the bronzed face of his pal at
thus having his own opinion confirmed; for Perk valued a few words of praise
from Jack far above any other source.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kinder get to thinkin&#8217; that Greek sponger&#8211;Alexis was his
name, if my memory ain&#8217;t gimme <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_24'></a>24</span> the bounce&#8211;was a bit o&#8217; a sharper,
an&#8217; knew beans in the bargain from the way them black eyes o&#8217; his&#8217;n
kept watchin&#8217; us all the time we asked questions, just like we&#8217;d
heard people sayin&#8217; queer things concernin&#8217; how easy it was to grab
any quantity o&#8217; bottled stuff if on&#8217;y you had the ready cash, an&#8217; a
good eye for winkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may know more about Alexis before we&#8217;re through with this
trip,&#8221; was all Jack would say concerning the matter. &#8220;On my part
I&#8217;m shaking hands with myself because we were smart enough to camouflage
our ship with green stuff for that pilot passed over and could have glimpsed our
crate lying half hidden here, and through his glasses&#8211;which I understand
they all carry&#8211;made out how it didn&#8217;t match up with any of the
aircraft they use in their business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to you, partner,&#8221; Perk hastened to confess. &#8220;If it
all depended on my poor head I kinder guess I&#8217;d a&#8217;slipped up right then
an&#8217; there an&#8217; give the hull scheme away which would a&#8217;been a danged
shame, an&#8217; busted the game higher&#8217;n a kite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We make a pretty good team, matey,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Sometimes
it&#8217;s you that goes loco, and threatens to step off your base, and then
another time I feel myself side-slipping and have to lean on you to hold my own.
That&#8217;s just how it should <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_25'></a>25</span> be with partners&#8211;give and take, with never a
bleat if our calculations go wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s right nice o&#8217; you to talk that way, brother,&#8221;
Perk hastened to assert, beaming with pride and making out as if tempted to
begin scratching again when Jack reaching around, gently steered his clutching
fingers away from the itching locality, at which Perk heaved a relieved sigh and
nodded his thanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sky has lost most of that glorious color,&#8221; mentioned the
head pilot, &#8220;and before long now we can be hopping-off. Our first job will
be to swing down the coast and learn if there seems to be anything going on
among the southern islands in this beastly mangrove section where a man could
easy enough lose himself for keeps among the countless water passages and
inlets. See here, what&#8217;s the matter with you, staring that way,
Perk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that jar you now,&#8221; snapped the other, &#8220;that
Robin ship is headin&#8217; back this way; or else some other crate that looks
like its twin!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CURTISS-ROBIN PLANE</span></h2>

<p>Jack, a bit startled by his companion&#8217;s sudden exclamation, took a good
look and hastened to remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon now you hit the nail on the head that time, Perk and it&#8217;s
heading this way in the bargain. Why d&#8217;ye suppose we didn&#8217;t see the
crate before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I kinder guess now,&#8221; Perk went on to say, &#8220;she bust
out o&#8217; that little fog cloud right to the south&#8211;a&#8217;swoopin&#8217; up
the coast, you notice, partner, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure is,&#8221; assented Jack, as though that small circumstance
assumed some importance in his eyes, as well as those of his comrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger pop! but mebee I ain&#8217;t glad we didn&#8217;t show any
hurry to kick off this camouflage green stuff, thinkin&#8217; it&#8217;d served
its purpose okay and could be knocked into the discard. See how they keep
dodging&#8217; in an&#8217; out like they might be scourin&#8217; every foot
o&#8217; shore line, little bays back o&#8217; these mangrove islands an&#8217;
all. Strikes me <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
they&#8217;re a&#8217;searchin&#8217; for somethin&#8217;, Jack, which might be the
pair o&#8217; us, eh, what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; snapped Jack, without hesitating a second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which, I take it, would mean there might a&#8217;been some sort o&#8217;
little leak up at Headquarters, hang the luck, when we figured we&#8217;d got
the gang buffaloed right smart. Don&#8217;t think they c&#8217;n lamp us lyin&#8217;
here, do you, Boss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Small chance of that, boy, if only we lie low, and make no move apt to
attract their attention,&#8221; Perk was told in a confident tone that
effectually calmed his rising alarm.</p>

<p>He hastened to settle down in a position where he could thrust his glasses
between interstices in the green covering of the fusilage and wings so as to
keep close tabs on the advancing plane without making any particular movement of
arms or body.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Jack, a few seconds later, when he fancied his mate
must have made up his mind as to the identity of the flying ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curtiss-Robin crate, that&#8217;s right, Jack an&#8217; the same we
saw before,&#8221; replied the observer, excitedly. &#8220;Hey! guess now they
got a glass up there too. I sure saw the sun shinin&#8217; on somethin&#8217;
bright, &#8217;cause the old boy&#8217;s still on deck to chaps that high
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve discounted that fact long ago, Perk; men <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span> engaged in the desperate
game they&#8217;re playing night after night would need such a useful
instrument, so&#8217;s to keep a sharp lookout for Coast Guard boats or bunches
of revenue men lying in ambush close to the place they expected to land a wet
cargo, or a couple of high-pay Chinks, it might be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you got an idea they must have a spy up in Washington&#8211;a
sneaker who c&#8217;n find out what&#8217;s bein&#8217; hatched up so&#8217;s to cook
their goose an&#8217; that he manages to get warnin&#8217; down here to the
workin&#8217; crews so&#8217;s to put &#8217;em on their guard&#8211;is that it,
partner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks that way&#8211;that&#8217;s all I can say, Perk. Now lie low and
don&#8217;t do any talking, though with their crate kicking up all that row I
reckon there&#8217;d be small chance of their hearing us even if we
shouted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk was chuckling to himself at a great rate and could not keep from taking
advantage of the invitation Jack had really extended to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah! an&#8217; I kinder guess now we got one thing they ain&#8217;t,
which is a silencer on our engine that&#8217;ll keep it muzzled, even if it does
knock off a bit o&#8217; our speed when we happen to use it. Luckiest thing ever
you managed to get the Big Boss to send us such a bully contrivance that seems
to work jest great. Listen to the racket they&#8217;re kickin&#8217; up right
now&#8211;enough to tell any <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_29'></a>29</span> chump ten miles off a crate&#8217;s headin&#8217; his
way. Jerusalem crickets! but ain&#8217;t I glad we&#8217;re fixed as we
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ship far up in the heavens was almost directly over them by this time and
Perk relapsed into silence, being vastly interested in watching it passing
over.</p>

<p>Possibly he had his eyes glued on the figures&#8211;there were two occupants
in the Robin&#8217;s cabin he could easily see&#8211;leaning over and doubtless
closely scrutinizing the intricacies of the ragged shoreline below, hoping to
make important discoveries.</p>

<p>If the leading figure, piloting the craft, was actually Oscar Gleeb, onetime
noted Hun ace over in the Argonne, it might be Perk, with his past war history
rising up to thrill him afresh, may have found himself half expecting to hear a
terrific explosion close by on the shore as the German flier let drop some sort
of bomb, with the idea of striking their concealed bus which his keen eyes might
have detected despite their wonderful camouflage.</p>

<p>But nothing like that came to pass and the cruising ship kept moving in a
northerly direction, growing less distinct as miles were being covered at the
fast clip it swept along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cripes! that was worth somthin&#8217; to glimpse, bet your sweet life,
partner,&#8221; Perk finally <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_30'></a>30</span> observed as he ventured to make a little movement,
feeling dreadfully cramped and the danger of discovery growing momentarily less
as the first shades of coming evening began to gather around the secluded cove.
&#8220;Jest as like as not they started away down toward the tip o&#8217; the
mainland, an&#8217; hev been examinin&#8217; every mile o&#8217; the coast, bent
on doin&#8217; a clean job while they&#8217;re at it. An&#8217; if they meet up
with no luck mebbe now they&#8217;ll make up their minds it was only a false
alarm, and let her go at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently they could no longer glimpse the faintest sign of the scout
plane&#8211;when last seen it was still heading up the coast as though making
for some destination where action awaited the members of its daring crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;The passing of that crate settles one thing, anyway,&#8221; observed
Jack presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;As what, partner?&#8221; queried Perk, who had already begun to denude
the anchored amphibian of its covering, as though it was settled they need no
longer fear being spied upon from above.</p>

<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t bother striking into the south when starting out to
look for suspicious lights, such as would tell of business being put
through&#8211;those boys are right now heading for their rendezvous and
it&#8217;s our game to chase after them, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_31'></a>31</span> as soon as nightfall makes it safe to get a move
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That suits me fine, Jack old hoss. I&#8217;m right sick o&#8217;
keepin&#8217; our nose stuck so close to the ground&#8211;me for the high places
where I c&#8217;n get my lungs filled with clean air&#8211;this swamp stuff
don&#8217;t make no sort o&#8217; hit with me, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you.
Gosh! looky at that bunch o&#8217; measly big pelicans flappin&#8217; their
wings as they fly close to the water, headin&#8217; to some island where they
have a rookery, like as not. An&#8217; Jack, honest to goodness if I
didn&#8217;t see the head an&#8217; knobby eyes o&#8217; a monster scaly &#8217;gator
stickin&#8217; up out o&#8217; the water in the lagoon jest now. Got me goofy,
this sorter thing, an&#8217; I&#8217;m asighin&#8217; for the air lanes two
miles high.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand just how you feel, Perk, but hold your horses a bit.
Hurry is something we&#8217;ve got to fight shy of in this game of hide-and-seek
with these dangerous smugglers of the gulf coast. As smart a group of men as we
can ever claim to be, have bucked up against the gang and dropped out of the
chase&#8211;more than a few of whom have disappeared mysteriously, and up at
Headquarters it&#8217;s believed they&#8217;ve met with foul play. This big Mex
gulf hides a heap of secrets and has ever since old Blackbeard and that crowd of
buccaneers used to sink Spanish galleons after looting them of their gold cargo
and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span> sending hundreds
of poor wretches to a watery grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wise to all them facts, partner,&#8221; piped up Perk,
grinning amiably, &#8220;an&#8217; I sure don&#8217;t hanker after bein&#8217;
sent down to that port o&#8217; missin&#8217; men in no hurry. I&#8217;ll stick
it out on this line jest as long as you say an&#8217; try to keep from
grumblin&#8217;. Thar goes the last o&#8217; the rotten stuff overboard, Boss,
an&#8217; we&#8217;re all clear again. While we&#8217;re a&#8217;waitin&#8217; till
the last speck o&#8217; daylight slickers away, wouldn&#8217;t it be right smart
if we set our teeth in some o&#8217; that fine grub I laid in, to keep us from
starvin&#8217; to death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suits me okay, buddy; suppose you trot it out and we&#8217;ll pas the
time away bolstering up our strength&#8211;no telling what we may have before us
tonight if we happen to strike rich pay-dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly they busied themselves with what to Perk especially was a most
agreeable occupation, for it must be confessed that the Maine lad possessed a
fairly good appetite while his capacity for storing away good things was
something close to marvelous.</p>

<p>So the night settled down around them&#8211;sounds indicative of a Florida
coast camping ground began to make themselves manifest&#8211;mullet jumped up
out of the brackish water where some stream emptied its tide straight from <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span> the Everglades into the
gulf, to fall back again with resounding splashes. Now and then there was a
rush, and a great deal of agitation of the water close to one of the mangrove
islands, showing where some fierce piratical deep water fish was making an
evening meal of the unlucky mullet&#8211;several wild ducks came spinning along
from other shore places to settle further in where the reedy islands offered
effectual shelter from night-raiding owls and hawks that could see in the
dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; Perk was saying as he finished eating and started to
put away what sandwiches and other stuff had been left over, &#8220;this sure
must be a dandy place to do some shore shootin&#8217; an&#8217; if I
hadn&#8217;t other fish to fry I&#8217;d like to hang around a week&#8217;r so,
takin&#8217; toll o&#8217; ducks, turkey, an&#8217; deer up on the mainland,
with like as not a bobcat, or even a panther in the bargain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All very fine for those who are down here sporting for sport,
brother,&#8221; Jack told him, &#8220;but our bunch has another kind of game to
pull in and you&#8217;ve got to forget all this temptation so as to buckle down
to business. Reckon it&#8217;s time for us to be hopping-off and getting that
taste of cool, clean air a mile or so up. Shake a leg, buddy, and we&#8217;ll
shove off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack, of course, had long since figured just what he meant to do when the
moment arrived <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span> to
leave their hiding place and take to their wings again, so after their little
anchor had been drawn out of the mud, carefully washed, and then stowed away
where it would take little room and not be in the way, each of the occupants of
the double cockpit set about carrying out their customary duties when a
launching was in order.</p>

<p>&#8220;All set, Mister Pilot!&#8221; remarked Perk, finally, &#8220;give her
the gun, boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>With only a fraction of the rush and roar usually connected with a start, the
amphibian, with cut-out choked down, commenced to glide through the water of the
partly enclosed bay, heading straight for the jaws of land beyond which lay the
open and mighty gulf.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>LIKE A NIGHT OWL ON THE WING</span></h2>

<p>The rush and gurgle of the water parted by the pontoons beneath the fuselage
of the plane was sounding most delightful to the ears of Perk as he sat there
watching the jaws of land draw rapidly nearer.</p>

<p>Resting up was always a painful thing to Perk whose nerves called for action
and had done so ever since he served in the flying corps across the Atlantic
when men&#8217;s souls thrilled with frequent contacts in the line of equally
daring Hun war pilots.</p>

<p>Now they had shot past the twin points and were out upon the open gulf, their
speed increasing every second as Jack pulled the stick closer against his chest.
Then the experienced pilot lifted her in a zoom that was simply magnificent, and
they were off on their adventure at last.</p>

<p>Rising fast, the boat was soon at a good ceiling for flying. So too the night
promised all manner of favorable things for men of their calling&#8211;up where
they were the wind did not amount to much but it was blowing at quite a lively
rate <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span> closer to the
earth and doubtless the broad palmetto leaves must be making a considerable
slashing as they struck one another, dead and withered ones sawing like some
giant violin bow.</p>

<p>This, with the wash of the waves upon the pebbled beach, would make enough
noise to effectually deaden the whirr of the propeller&#8211;the new and novel
muffler or silencer, fashioned very much on the order of such a contraption as
successfully applied to small firearms, was doing wonderfully, and Perk every
little while made motions as though shaking hands with himself because of this
addition to their security, for under the usual conditions prevailing anything
like secrecy in a noisy airship had been unknown to the sky detectives.</p>

<p>Perk had been under a strange hallucination when that other plane was soaring
overhead&#8211;in fact he was once again back in the Argonne, with his boat
hugging the earth, and an enemy swooping in circles overhead&#8211;he had even
gone so far as to imagine the German war ace might be maneuvering so as to drop
one of his bombs straight down on the stranded craft, with results that must
spell a complete wipeout.</p>

<p>When they did not have their handy earphones in service Jack and his right
bower had arranged a secret alphabet of signals, consisting of all manner of
pokes and nudges, by means of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_37'></a>37</span> which they were enabled to communicate along
professional lines at least. If it seemed necessary to Perk to ask questions not
down on the brief list thus worked out, all he had to do was to adjust
Jack&#8217;s harness and then his own little outfit, enabling him to chatter
away to his heart&#8217;s content&#8211;and often to the annoyance of his less
talkative chum.</p>

<p>But first of all he proceeded to make good use of the binoculars upon which
so much depended. From side to side he would swing the glasses and search for
anything that looked like a suspicious light on land or water then turn to what
lay dead ahead.</p>

<p>In this region of the Ten Thousand Islands&#8211;all fashioned from the queer
spreading mangrove that drops its long seeds so that they stick upright in the
mud, and, quickly developing roots, spring up to add to the dimension of the
original &#8220;island&#8221; there were never at any time many settlers so that
the coast has been reckoned as the &#8220;loneliest ever,&#8221; on which
account Perk realized that if he should happen to glimpse a light, whether on
land or gulf, the chances were fifty to one it might have some connection with
the operations of the smuggler league.</p>

<p>Perk remembered how that Curtiss-Robin ship had finally disappeared in the
haze lying to the north and from this he sucked more or less <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span> consolation, since it
seemed evident the location of their job must lie in that quarter toward which
they were now bound like a great owl swooping on noiseless pinions to seize its
prey.</p>

<p>A delicious thrill ran through his frame from time to time. If any one could
&#8220;get a kick&#8221; from such a situation it was Perk, who was already
visioning some sort of a battle royal when they struck the smuggling gang in the
midst of their lawless work. The gang did their best to create a reign of
terror.</p>

<p>Once far out toward the west, where rolled the tides of the broad gulf that
stretched for a distance of five hundred miles across to the Coast of Mexico, he
certainly did glimpse a light, low down on the horizon where just the faintest
gleam of the late departed day still lingered. Ha! the mother ship no doubt,
riding at anchor some miles out where the gulf was shallow and holding ground
good&#8211;a heavily laden sailing craft, coming possibly from the Bahamas, and
passing into the gulf between the Florida keys. Its captain knowing that the
cargo they carried could be much more easily landed there than around Miami,
where the Coast Guard was more vigilant.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly did Perk stare, picturing the shore motorboats speeding
out through the gloom toward that signal light to take aboard <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span> their several loads and
make for certain secluded harbors where trucks would be waiting to transfer the
illicit stuff to its destined markets where prices ranged high with the holidays
approaching and rich, thirsty tourists to be supplied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bang! it&#8217;s gone blooie!&#8221; Perk suddenly told himself as he
no longer found himself able to distinguish that suspicious gleam which had
gradually grown dim and then utterly vanished from view. &#8220;Now, what in
thunder does that mean I want to know&#8211;why should they douse the glim in
such a hurry&#8211;wonder if they could have caught any sound from us to give
&#8217;em a scare? I&#8217;m in a tail-spin, seems like. Oh I shucks! mebee it
was on&#8217;y a measly star after all, that&#8217;s set back o&#8217; the horizon.
Who got fooled that time, I want to know, Gabe Perkiser, you smarty?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took it humorously, happening to be one of those sensible lads capable of
laughing, even when the joke was on himself.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Perk picked up what seemed to be a low-lying light, this
time off toward the east, where he knew the land lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I kinder guess that ain&#8217;t a silly star,&#8221; was the way
he expressed his feelings as he continued to watch the glimmering object that
rose and then grew dim, only to once more flash brightly. &#8220;Might be some
squatter sittin&#8217; alongside <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_40'></a>40</span> his campfire&#8211;mebbe a fishing camp, on&#8217;y I got
an idea the light comes from a big lantern and not a blazing fire. Strikes me it
oughter bear watchin&#8217; just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute afterwards and he could no longer see the object of his concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;By jinks! what sort o&#8217; hocus-pocus might <i>that</i> be, I want
to know&#8211;did somebody blow that light out just when I was hopin&#8217; big
things might come from it, or was it only a bunch o&#8217; cabbage palms that
come in between me an&#8217; the glow?&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not reappear, although Perk kept turning his glasses in that
particular quarter time after time, as fresh hopes awakened.</p>

<p>The amphibian was running as smooth as silk, Perk told himself more than
once&#8211;why not, when they had most carefully checked it over with scrupulous
exactness, so as to be able to pronounce it in perfect condition. That new
muffler did the work like magic and Perk really began to feel as though the
efficiency of their aerial mount had been increased a hundred per cent by the
installation of such an up-to-date contrivance, even if it did cut their speed
down more or less&#8211;when they had good need of swift wings it could be done
away with, since racket was powerless to hurt them then.</p>

<p>A few clouds had started up and were drifting <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span> overhead by this time. Perk gave them
several hasty looks, possibly wondering whether there could be any chance of a
sudden blow arising since indeed they came from the southwest, where many of the
rains and high winds had their brewing place, far out on the mighty gulf to be
followed in turn by a &#8220;norther,&#8221; cold and violent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That might be rotten luck for us,&#8221; he grumbled, sensing trouble
in putting Jack&#8217;s scheme into operation, &#8220;but I guess there
ain&#8217;t anything to it&#8211;right cool even downstairs, I noticed an&#8217;
they tell me it always heats up afore one o&#8217; these fall rains come
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put that matter out of his mind as hardly worthy of attention then a
minute later he made another discovery. Again his attention was turned toward
the west, for a light had appeared low down, a light that actually moved, this
fact convincing the vigilant observer it could by no possibility be another
setting star in the bright firmament above.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the genuine stuff, or I&#8217;ll eat my hat!&#8221; was
his characteristic way of confirming this fresh discovery, and there was
certainly a trace of triumph noticeable in his voice, as though this would wipe
out his former blunder.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DANCE OF THE FIREFLIES</span></h2>

<p>Perk, now fully convinced that he had &#8220;struck oil,&#8221; as he
mentally termed it, laid the binoculars down on the front seat beside his pal
and gave him certain nudges in his side, thereby telling him he, Perk, would
take over the controls while the head pilot used the glasses.</p>

<p>When this had been accomplished Perk managed to point toward the west, so as
to draw the attention of his mate thither without any waste of precious
time.</p>

<p>Of course Jack immediately located the light and was watching it closely. He
could easily make it out to be a lantern that must be on the deck of a vessel,
since he discovered a mast and rigging near by, also the moving figures of
several men.</p>

<p>The lantern did not remain stationary more than a few seconds at a time, but
kept up a swinging movement that was eccentric to say the least, now passing
back and forth like the weighty pendulum in an old-fashioned
&#8220;grandfather&#8221; clock; then with an up-and-down action and, as <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span> a windup performing a
circular movement, repeated twice.</p>

<p>Of course Jack understood that those on board the smuggler must be trying to
signal to those of their group who were on shore, the land workers of the
hard-working bunch, which conclusion caused him to turn his attention in that
quarter.</p>

<p>At first he was not rewarded by any discovery but not in the least
discouraged he continued to wave his glasses back and forth, feeling certain
those continuous signals from out on the gulf must be noticed and returned.</p>

<p>He chanced to be again watching the moving gleam when he felt Perk trying to
gain his attention and when this had been accomplished pointing eagerly off to
the east.</p>

<p>Yes, there it was as plain as anything&#8211;in fact there seemed to be two
separate lights looking like twin stars and even as Jack watched he saw them
carry on in a most remarkable fashion. Now one would be in violent motion,
perhaps doing some intricate figure that had a meaning; then the other would
join in, with the pair swinging back and forth, crossing each other&#8217;s
path, and going through the most wonderful evolutions.</p>

<p>To Jack&#8217;s mind they looked like a pair of gigantic fireflies gone loco
with excitement and carrying on in the most astonishing manner. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span> Indeed, he could easily
picture it as a wild dance of make-believe insects on a greatly magnified
scale.</p>

<p>Of course Jack never had the slightest doubt as to what all this mystifying
activity must be&#8211;the two extremes of the smuggling fraternity were
exchanging signals&#8211;each and every movement had a meaning of its own and
conveyed such information as was most valuable to the business in hand&#8211;in
Jack&#8217;s mind it was as though the conversation might be running something
after this fashion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here we are on hand according to promise, with a full cargo of
the finest wet stuff you ever had drop down on your coast. How does the land lie
over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coast all clear&#8211;we will start the fleet out to lighten your
cargo right away&#8211;keep the beacon burning so they&#8217;ll make a straight
line to your anchorage, which will mean a saving of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We get your meaning&#8211;glad you are so prompt to send back
word&#8211;come right along and get your invoice&#8211;the more the merrier,
boys. Wind getting rougher, and we ought to be off this shallow shore before it
swings around any more. Don&#8217;t hold back&#8211;Merry Christmas to you all,
boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk on his part was also trying to keep tabs on all that was going on, not
neglecting his duties <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_45'></a>45</span> with the controls, it can be set down as certain. He
twisted his neck and cast swift glances first to the right and then in the
opposite direction, fascinated by that flashing beacon conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gum! if they ain&#8217;t holdin&#8217; a regular confab with them
lights,&#8221; Perk was telling himself, delighted with his opportunity to
witness such a proceeding, knowing as he did what this all meant to himself and
Jack. &#8220;That guy on shore is sure some punkins about this signal
layout&#8211;works jest like a Boy Scout might, sending a message across to
another o&#8217; the troop standin&#8217; on top o&#8217; a high
peak&#8211;makes me think I&#8217;m back on the front, with Signal Corps men
wigwaggin&#8217; for all that&#8217;s out. Huh! There goes them twin lights,
showin&#8217; the chinnin&#8217; must be over with both sides posted on the
program. Say, ain&#8217;t this the boss job though? I guess I never did get half
as much fun outen any game I tackled before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Jack signalled that he wished to handle the stick once more, which
the other was indeed not sorry for, since it began to look as though they were
close to a critical moment when considerable skill would be required in
manipulating the ship so as to accomplish their ends without unduly alarming
those they spied upon.</p>

<p>Already they had managed to collect a certain amount of valuable facts which
were only <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> guessed at
previously, so cleverly had these transfer bases been kept concealed from the
most skillful of the Government agents. Perk himself felt confident that they
were as yet only on the threshold of still more important discoveries.</p>

<p>It was one of Perk&#8217;s peculiar little eccentricities that he could do
better thinking if only he had a bit of chewing gum between his teeth, just to
keep some muscles at work, he said, and in some mysterious fashion having this
energy pass from his working jaws to his brain and hasten its activities.</p>

<p>So what did he do now but fumble in a pocket of his oily dungarees and
produce a slab of his favorite brand, Perk thrusting it into his mouth and
savagely rolling it between his teeth, really believed this helped his brain to
function more easily.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may have done so&#8211;some people have all manner of strange
hallucinations, which, being favored, bring satisfaction to their train of
thought. If Perk actually believed in his remedy that was half the battle and no
other person&#8217;s business whatsoever.</p>

<p>Looking out to sea he could still find that lone beacon, even without the aid
of his binoculars. It was easy for such an imaginative fellow to picture in his
mind the lingering sloop, loaded to the gunwales with case goods, worth almost a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span> millionaire&#8217;s
ransom&#8211;the dark sailors from Bimimi lolling around on deck, ready to
up-sail and flee should the slightest sign of a Coast Guard raid make itself
manifest. From off toward the distant shore line there came dully to their
listening ears the repeated throb of one or more speed boats hastening to lay
alongside and transfer their prearranged quota of cases, after which the burden
of getting the illicit cargo safely landed would rest on the shoulders of those
who manned the smaller smuggler craft.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful little game, Perk was assuring himself, when he realized
how everything had been arranged to make things work as though greased. As the
isolated places along the gulf coast were without number and the enforcement
agents woefully pressed to even half cover their allotted territory, the reason
for the few arrests that had rewarded the most strenuous efforts on the part of
the Coast Guard could be easily comprehended.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s just why they picked out Jack, out of all the boys in
the service, loaded him up with this here amphibian crate that c&#8217;n drop down on
land or water, it don&#8217;t matter a darn which, got him a sort o&#8217; side
partner to help make things go and turned him loose to pull in the net. Huh!
we&#8217;ll know before long just what this racket is goin&#8217; to wind up in,
for we&#8217;ve made our first <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_48'></a>48</span> move, our hat&#8217;s thrown into the ring, and
we&#8217;ll either make Pike&#8217;s Peak, or&#8211;bust!&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently Perk began to convince himself he could at times pick up the
throbbing sound of a humming motor, undoubtedly one of those on their way out to
the supply boat off shore some miles and ready to deliver such number of
high-priced cases as the lists called for.</p>

<p>Yes, when the night wind veered or shifted a bit he was absolutely certain
about picking up the chug-chug-chug that betrayed the presence of the leading
speed boat.</p>

<p>About this time Perk noticed two separate things that had a bearing on their
mission&#8211;the first was that for some reason they no longer romped along at
their earlier speed, showing that the pilot had seen fit to slacken his craft to
a considerable degree, though keeping up steerage way. The second thing that
struck Perk was the fact that they were slowly but surely making a decided swing
off to the west, which if continued would make their immediate course a complete
circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it, old hoss!&#8221; he was saying, just as if he expected the
other to hear every word which was out of the question with that whirring
propeller keeping up its low, sing-song tone. &#8220;You got &#8217;em beat a
mile when it comes to playin&#8217; safe, that&#8217;s right. Don&#8217;t want
to rile the water an&#8217; let <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_49'></a>49</span> everybody in on the fact that we&#8217;re
hangin&#8217; around here, waitin&#8217; for somethin&#8217; to turn up. &#8217;Sides,
it ain&#8217;t good policy to make the ten-strike till they got the stuff on
board the chuggin&#8217; speed boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was intensely interested in Jack&#8217;s play for time and listened with
his heart almost up in his throat, fearing lest the steady chugging should
suddenly stop and the game be thrown by default. But no, it was keeping on in
perfect rhythm, sounding in Perk&#8217;s ear something like the tattoo of a
machine-gun in action and sending out its swarm of leaden missiles&#8211;a sound
that had long ago become so familiar to his ears as never to be forgotten,
despite the lapse of time.</p>

<p>Surely by now that leading boat must be getting close to the schooner so that
the transfer would soon be an accomplished fact, after which the return trip was
due to be started which was when they meant to break into the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger pop! if I don&#8217;t ketch the grumble o&#8217; a second tug
further away, and I guess now a consid&#8217;able bigger craft than the leadin&#8217;
one. Get a move on, fellers&#8211;the dinner gong&#8217;s struck and the
grub&#8217;s on the table waitin&#8217; to be swallered&#8211;first come, first
served&#8217;s the rule things go by, so stir your stumps, an&#8217; put in the
best licks you know how&#8211;an&#8217; may the devil take the hindmost. Hey
there! that drummin&#8217; noise, it&#8217;s stopped&#8211;wonder <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span> if they got out to the
sloop or else smell a rat an&#8217; are lyin&#8217; low till they make it a dead
certainty? Gosh, but ain&#8217;t this all mighty thrillin&#8217; though, and how
it does tickle me most to death,&#8221; muttering which Perk, still listening,
actually held his breath the better to catch any sound from below.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>A BATTLE ROYAL</span></h2>

<p>Jack, being desirous of ascertaining just what was taking place over where
the sloop laden with contraband was anchored, did his best glide or coast, a
feature at which he was most competent.</p>

<p>When the engine ceased to function and the whizzing propeller lost much of
its dizzy momentum, both he and Perk strained their ears so as to catch any
sound calculated to inform them as to what was going on.</p>

<p>The trick proved worth while, for plainly they could make out human voices;
also a certain rumbling sound that Jack imagined might be caused by the rush
back and forth of a small hand truck on which cases of imported liquid
refreshment were loaded.</p>

<p>This told the story to the effect that the speed launch must have reached the
schooner and was lying alongside with its intended cargo being delivered with no
loss of time. Probably, if everything went with machine-like precision, the
speed boat would soon be fully laden and started back toward some secret haven
where big motor trucks <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_52'></a>52</span> would be waiting to transport the cargo to Tampa, St.
Petersburg, or some other city to the north.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the second boat was due around that time&#8211;they could hear her
hoarse exhaust as she bucked the billows rolling in toward the shore line and a
moving light about half a mile distant betrayed her position.</p>

<p>If one thing tickled Perk more than another just then it was the realization
that he and Jack held aces in the game&#8211;their possession of that almost
priceless muffler, by means of which they could approach fairly close without
the working motor betraying their coming, gave them an enormous advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sure have got the upper hand in this tangle,&#8221; Perk was
telling himself in great glee as he listened to the chugging of the second
transfer boat. &#8220;Huh! I kinder guess them guys been sleepin&#8217; at the
switch not to savvy what a bully thing one o&#8217; these here silencers&#8217;d
be to the smugglin&#8217; game. Looks like it might be a walk-over for our team,
if the luck on&#8217;y holds good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack had about decided on his course of action. He did not mean that either
of those boats should get safely ashore with their loads, if he had anything to
say about it, and he reckoned he had.</p>

<p>Still, it was not politic to be too quick on the trigger&#8211;they could
just continue to hang around <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_53'></a>53</span> and be ready to pounce down on their intended prey
after the fashion of a hungry eagle striking a fat duck that had been selected
out of the flock on the feeding grounds.</p>

<p>One thing he did do was to cut his intended wide circle short and again head
toward the scene of action, a move that certainly afforded the eager Perk more
or less satisfaction, he being thrilled with the expectation of breaking into
the game without much more loss of time.</p>

<p>But you never can tell just what may happen when rival forces are striving
against one another. The best laid plans often go wrong and there was always a
chance of the unexpected happening.</p>

<p>Hardly had the airship whipped around again so as to head into the north than
Perk became aware of the fact that there was a sudden accesssion of weird noises
springing up from the goal toward which they were now aiming. Jack, too must
have caught the increased volume, for he sheered off as if to hold back a bit so
as to grasp the meaning of the new racket.</p>

<p>Men were no longer simply talking or laughing as they so cheerfully labored
in transferring some of the contraband from the sloop to the deck of the
speedboat&#8211;their voices were raised to shouts in which surprise, even the
element of near-panic, could be detected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>Then came a flash,
succeeded by a sharp report, undoubtedly standing for the discharge of some
species of firearm! Others of a similar character immediately followed until
there were all the elements of a genuine rough and tumble fight discernible in
the growing confusion and uproar.</p>

<p>Perk was astounded by such unaccountable goings-on. Whatever could possess
these smugglers to start a fight among themselves, when such a disturbance was
likely to be heard by any Coast Guard boat that might happen to be cruising
within ten miles of the spot and bring down all manner of serious trouble on
their heads, certainly breaking up the fine combination that had been effected
for that especial delivery?</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy smoke! they sure must a&#8217;gone looney!&#8221; Perk was telling
himself, lost in wonder and dismay, for he began to suspect that this would be
apt to mix their own plans and upset all Jack&#8217;s calculations.</p>

<p>It would seem to be the only explanation possible&#8211;that some of the case
goods had been tampered with, the result being that the willing workers were not
only hilarious, but ready to start a rough-house then and there on the deck of
the schooner.</p>

<p>Then suddenly remembering how both he and Jack had their head-phone harness
attached, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span> could
thus exchange words when they pleased, Perk broke loose in his usual impulsive
fashion, seeking the light which he somehow had reason to believe his chum could
give him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz! partner, what&#8217;s broke loose, would you say?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;Them guys act like they&#8217;d been tryin&#8217; out the high
power stuff they fetched all the way from the Bahamas. Danged if it don&#8217;t
sound to me like a reg&#8217;lar old Irish Tipperary Fair fight&#8211;listen to
&#8217;em shootin&#8217; things up to beat the band! Say, if they keep
agoin&#8217; like that, they&#8217;ll smash every case they got an&#8217; we
won&#8217;t find any evidence to grab. Got a line on the racket, old
boss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fight, and a lively one at that,&#8221; admitted the
pilot, &#8220;but I reckon you&#8217;re away off when you figure it&#8217;s a
ruction between those on the schooner and the boys of that speedboat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got me guessin&#8217; partner,&#8221; said the puzzled Perk;
&#8220;then who&#8217;s mixed up in the shindy, I want to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds a whole lot like hijackers to me, Perk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger pop! Is <i>that</i> what it means then, Jack&#8211;some tough
guys been out there on the gulf keepin&#8217; a close watch on the schooner that
came up the coast loaded to the gun&#8217;ls with case goods, an&#8217; crept in with
small boats to make a big haul! Listen to &#8217;em squabble, will you, boy?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span> What wouldn&#8217;t
I give for daylight so&#8217;s to see that boss shindy&#8211;shootin&#8217;
keeps a&#8217;goin&#8217; on like the old days over there&#8211;wow! They must be a
bunch o&#8217; rotten marksmen, or the whole lot&#8217;d be wiped out afore this
time. What&#8217;re we a&#8217;goin&#8217; to do &#8217;bout it, Jack&#8211;we ought
to have some say what&#8217;s to be done with all that stuff&#8211;no use
bein&#8217; eagles o&#8217; the skies if we gotter stick around an&#8217; let a
measly set o&#8217; hawks get away with the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re <i>not</i> aiming to
do!&#8221; snapped Jack, as he banked, and once again headed in the direction of
the spot where all that wild commotion was taking place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get you, boy&#8211;the machine-gun, is it?&#8221; barked Perk,
starting up from his seat as though to make ready.</p>

<p>Before he could throw off his head-harness Jack stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait&#8211;you got me wrong&#8211;let the gun lie where it is. You
know we never expect to use it unless our lives are in danger. Get the bombs,
Perk&#8211;the simple tear bombs&#8211;they ought to fill the bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk evidently not only understood now but was fully in sympathy with the
scheme Jack had hatched out under the spur of necessity&#8211;quick thinking was
one of young Ralston&#8217;s strong points and his cleverness along those lines
had served <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span> him
wonderfully on more than a few previous occasions, where the situation looked
desperate.</p>

<p>They were sliding down a steep glide with the engine shut off. The deck of
the nearby schooner was plainly visible due to the lights aboard, and the
successive discharges of firearms, each looked like a miniature flash of
lightning. As they approached the scene of confusion the racket grew in
volume,&#8211;a dozen men seemed to be whooping things up as though under the
impression that the battle could be won by sheer noise&#8211;and broken
heads.</p>

<p>Perk kept his wits, and managed to locate the small stock of tear bombs that
had been given into their charge, with the idea they might find them more or
less useful should they strike a superior force of reckless law breakers and get
into what Perk would call a &#8220;jam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already he had succeeded in clutching a couple of the round missiles that
were charged with the acrid gas that could play such havoc with human eyes as to
render the strongest men as weak as babes and settled down in a position where
he could throw them to advantage.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TEAR-BOMB ATTACK</span></h2>

<p>It was certainly a thrilling moment for Perk as he crouched there in his
awkward cubicle back of the pilot and waited for the proper second to arrive
when his accuracy at throwing the bombs would be tested.</p>

<p>Jack meanwhile had his hands full attending to his part of the
business&#8211;it was of course of prime importance that they should drop down
as close to the deck of the schooner as possible so the full effect of the
bursting tear-bombs might be felt by those struggling smugglers and hijackers,
but there was the mast of the cruising vessel to bear in mind since it towers
many feet in the air.</p>

<p>To strike this spar would entail danger of a crash, or having their
landing-gear torn away, which would prove a disaster. Consequently Jack held
himself in readiness to once more start his engine when sufficiently near the
object of his attack.</p>

<p>Perk knew just when their downward velocity terminated, for not only were
they again on a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
level keel, but the motor commenced working with its customary intensity and the
whole fusilage quivered as usual when they were under way.</p>

<p>All this had consumed mere fragments of a minute and Perk had already drawn
back his hand to make ready for his first toss. It was his intention to follow
this up with a second bomb, hurled in double-quick order, for a dual fire would
make the results more complete.</p>

<p>Jack left it completely to his comrade to decide just when to let fly,
relying on the lessons Perk had taken along those lines in order to make himself
as near perfect as possible. If it so chanced that their initial attack turned
out to be futile, it was always possible for the fighting airship to swing
around so as to permit a second attempt.</p>

<p>Much would depend on just how those who were struggling like mad wolves on
the deck of the schooner to gain or retain possession of the spoils took the
attack from the air. Jack rather fancied they would be panic stricken at having
a grim spectre of the skies descend on them like a plunging eagle and before
they could possibly recover sufficient energy to strike back, the monster roc
must have winged past, and the pungent gas started to affect their eyes,
rendering them frantic with a threatened temporary blindness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>Then Perk began
his share of the vicious attack. He followed out his prearranged programme with
machine-like movements, sending his first bomb with such cleverness that it
struck close to the stern, for Jack had made his hawk-like swoop so as to pass
completely along the entire length of the deck&#8211;this in order to give his
working pal a better chance to fulfill his assignment.</p>

<p>Even before that missile struck, Perk had instantly changed the other bomb to
his eager right hand and in a rapid-fire way sent it, too, hurtling downward, to
crash further on close to the bow.</p>

<p>Then they were speeding into space beyond the bowsprit of the anchored
rum-runner, with Jack starting to climb in order to bank and swing around, so as
to complete the job if his first endeavor lacked in any detail.</p>

<p>Lucky indeed for the two aviators that they had their goggles on, else they
too might have suffered from the fumes that so quickly spread in every direction
as though fanned by the night breeze. Perk afterwards admitted that he had
caught a whiff of the penetrating gas despite the covering helmet and
close-fitting goggles but thanks to the haste with which Jack carried their ship
past, the gas had little or no effect.</p>

<p>The clamor still continued, if anything, redoubled, for now the element of
fear had gripped <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span> the
hearts of every man on board both boats as they felt that terrible, unseen
agency stabbing at their eyes and making the stoutest writhe with agony and
alarm, thinking they must be doomed.</p>

<p>Jack could easily comprehend why they should be demoralized under the
prevailing conditions&#8211;there had been enough excitement in the air to start
with when the hijacker crowd boarded the rum-runner and joined issues with the
crews of the two allied boats but when from out of the skies there descended a
swooping monster, apparently about to fall upon them as might a stray meteor
from unlimited space in the firmament, and that strange, racking pain gripped
their eyes, nothing but panic could describe their condition with any degree of
accuracy.</p>

<p>But one element was now lacking in the dreadful turmoil&#8211;Perk could no
longer detect the quick percussion of blows, as fists and clubbed firearms
clashed against human bodies backed by a fierce anger that had been fanned into
a blaze by injuries received and a sense of impending victory, with the spoils
in sight.</p>

<p>Apparently every man among them was thinking of nothing save his own
individual sufferings and terror&#8211;unable to see with any degree of
certainty, they must be staggering this way and that, colliding with each other
and then one by one either falling into the water or else jumping <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span> aboard the speedboat so
conveniently nearby.</p>

<p>Jack had by this time brought the ship around again so as to head into the
wind as before. Perk, divining that this meant a second slash at the mob on the
sloop&#8217;s deck reached out for another relay of missiles. Now that he had
got started he was in prime condition to &#8220;keep the ball rolling&#8221;
until there did not remain a single hijacker or smuggler aboard the
rum-runner.</p>

<p>But Jack, more inclined to pity than the former war ace, did not make that
second dip&#8211;he had a good idea the punishment thus dealt out with their
initial swoop would be severe enough to clear the deck and set the late rival
forces to quitting the vicinity of the ill smelling sloop with the utmost speed,
regardless of the means employed to accomplish such a retreat while the going
held good.</p>

<p>Perk could hear splash after splash, as though the frenzied sufferers in
their agony had been seized with the possibility of cooling water being a
sovereign remedy for the ills that had so suddenly gripped their aching
eyeballs.</p>

<p>Perk was chuckling to himself, even as he continued to crouch there, and held
a third tear bomb ready for instant use when Jack was pleased to give him a
fitting opportunity to throw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zowie!&#8221; he was telling himself, &#8220;if that don&#8217;t <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span> make me think o&#8217; the
times when us boys lined up on a dock and made the dive, one right after
another&#8211;plunk&#8211;plunk&#8211;plunk! Go to it, you terriers&#8211;swim
for the shore, boys, and good luck to you all. Our job&#8217;ll be to pick up
the rum-boat with her juicy cargo, an&#8217; hand her over to some Government
official Jack knows about around these diggings. High&#8211;low&#8211;Jack
an&#8217; the smugglin&#8217; game&#8211;that spells the hull thing I kinder
guess!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk was by no means so lacking in sagacity not to understand just why his
comrade was hanging fire and keeping at a respectful distance from the sloop. He
wished sufficient time to elapse so that most of the penetrating gas from the
tear bombs would be carried off on the night wind and it might be reckoned safe
for them to go aboard.</p>

<p>He could vision the terrified hijackers after their speedy plunge overboard
managing to find their several boats and dragging themselves over the gunwales
with but one thought in their bewildered minds, and that to put as much distance
between themselves and the rum-runner as possible.</p>

<p>He even told himself he could catch the sound of splashing and oars working
madly in the locks, although this may have been only imagination on Perk&#8217;s
part, but for one thing, he did glimpse a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_64'></a>64</span> moving light and could detect a chugging movement
such as would accompany the inglorious flight of the speedboat, racing for some
shore harbor.</p>

<p>Silence followed, as though all the human elements in that late wild tumult
had managed to leave the scene of their defeat. Still Jack continued to swing
around in a short circle, showing how even with the spoils of victory close
within their reach he could keep to his standard maxim of &#8220;watch your
step!&#8221;</p>

<p>Minutes passed, and it went without question that the penetrating gas must be
well swept away by the night wind so that it would be safe for them to board
their prize and take a quick inventory of the illicit cargo.</p>

<p>Perk knew the time for action had arrived when he felt the plane head toward
the surface of the gulf, as though it was Jack&#8217;s intention to drop just
back of the sloop&#8217;s stern when they could taxi alongside and readily climb
to the low deck.</p>

<p>There was nothing surprising about their coming in contact with the surface
of the water&#8211;Jack had acquired a habit of making perfect landings whether
ashore or with pontoons. Knowing this, Perk never looked for anything else.</p>

<p>They came down with hardly any more of a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_65'></a>65</span> splash than a pelican might have made and almost
instantly Jack started taxiing ahead in the direction of the nearby anchored
sloop.</p>

<p>Perk had set the third tear-bomb down with the belief that there would be no
necessity for his using it. Silence hung about the sloop, and he had decided
there could be no one around, unless, when they clambered over the side, they
should discover some poor chap who had succumbed to the provoking gas or else
been stunned by a blow in the wild melee that had raged previously.</p>

<p>Just the same wise old Perk did not mean to be caught off his guard and so he
dragged out a formidable looking automatic, supplied by the Secret Service to
all its accredited agents as a means for compelling a surrender on the part of
any &#8220;wanted man&#8221; when overtaken in his flight.</p>

<p>The head-phones had been disconnected so there was nothing to hinder a prompt
boarding of the captured boat when Jack gave the word. With the glorious flush
of victory thrilling his whole frame Perk stood by to fend off as they drew
close to the squatty stern. It would be his duty to clamber out on one wing and
get aboard, carrying a rope by means of which the floating airship could be
secured to the water craft.</p>

<p>This he managed to accomplish without much <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_66'></a>66</span> difficulty, wondering while so doing whether he and
Jack might not be making history, for he suspected that never before in the
annals of aviation had an amphibian plane been afforded a chance to take a prize
of war in such an original fashion as bombarding the enemy crew with tear-gas
bombs and causing them to flee in mad haste.</p>

<p>It was an exultant Perk who stood erect on the deck and waved his flying
helmet with the proud air of a neophyte hunter planting his foot on the body of
his first slain lion or tiger.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A WHITE ELEPHANT ON THEIR HANDS</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Come on in, Jack old hoss, the water&#8217;s fine!&#8221; was the way
Perk greeted his chum after gaining the deck of the captured rum-runner.</p>

<p>&#8220;First make that rope fast somehow so we&#8217;ll run no risk of losing
our floating crate,&#8221; Jack advised him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do,
buddy,&#8221; continued the other, as he proceeded to make fast to the
sloop&#8217;s wheel after which Jack managed to clamber aboard.</p>

<p>There were lanterns scattered around, and in the haste with which the
afflicted crew had abandoned their ship no one had bothered about extinguishing
them. By means of the meagre illumination afforded by them, the two airmen were
able to take a fairly comprehensive survey of their surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I kinder guessed we&#8217;d find a bunch o&#8217; the
scrappin&#8217; critters stretched out, an&#8217; lookin&#8217; all bloody
like,&#8221; ventured Perk, with possibly a shadow of regret in his voice and
manner, &#8220;but shucks! never a one do I set my lamps on. Here&#8217;s <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span> a case or two o&#8217; wet
goods been busted open, seems like, in all that kickup an&#8217; mebbe now some
o&#8217; the wild boys got a taste that helped keep &#8217;em in the
roarin&#8217;, tearin&#8217; fight they had but looks as if every man must
a&#8217; been mighty keen on jumpin&#8217; his bail. Wow! I can&#8217;t blame
&#8217;em any, if the way my eyes feel is a fair sample o&#8217; what they got
served out to &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it, partner,&#8221; echoed Jack, &#8220;but keep from rubbing
it in, if you know what&#8217;s good for you. The gas is being carried away
right along by the breeze, so let&#8217;s forget it and take a look
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s,&#8221; echoed Perk, always more or less curious and eager
to &#8220;peek&#8221; when the chance offered.</p>

<p>It seemed as though they were alone on the anchored sloop that was rising and
falling on the long rollers coming in off the wide gulf. Piles of cases lay on
the deck around them, ready to be transferred to such smaller craft as were
expected to draw alongside with orders for them from some mysterious central
clearing house. Possibly there were many more similar packages down below, for
the sloop was evidently heavily laden.</p>

<p>Now and then the voluble member of the firm would let out a crisp exclamation
as though those keen eyes of his had run across some visible <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span> sign of the recent
rough-house disagreement that tickled him more or less.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sure broke in on a sweet little party all right, Jack,&#8221; he
observed, at one time with a chuckle, &#8220;see, here&#8217;s a broken bottle
that I guess must a&#8217; been smashed on some poor guy&#8217;s bean and from
the blood spots hereabout he had a plenty, but still he managed to skip out when
the grand march started. An&#8217; looky what I found&#8211;a coat that&#8217;s
tore into shreds. Gee whiz! but that was some hot tamale scrap, believe me.
I&#8217;d give somethin&#8217; for a chance to look in on the round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was apparently puzzling his own head over something that did not hit him
as so very humorous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he told Perk, with a grimace, &#8220;we&#8217;ve made a
bully capture all right, partner, but when you come to think twice it may be
we&#8217;ve got a white elephant on our hands after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! what d&#8217;ye mean by sayin&#8217; that, old pal?&#8221;
questioned the other, who apparently saw nothing in the affair calculated to
create any tendency toward dismay in his mind. &#8220;You got me in a tail spin,
partner&#8211;lift the lid, won&#8217;t you, an&#8217; gimme a look
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got the rum-boat okay, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks thataways, I guess,&#8221; Perk admitted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>&#8220;Just so,
and what d&#8217;ye reckon we&#8217;re going to do with it?&#8221; continued the
head pilot, hitting straight from the shoulder as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;er&#8211;ginger pop! that&#8217;s so, old hoss, <i>what?</i>
Mebbe now the shoe&#8217;s on the other foot, an&#8217; it&#8217;s the blamed
sloop that&#8217;s got us held up. Would it be proper to set the bally boat
afire and see all this hot stuff go up in flames? or we might knock a hole in
the bottom, an&#8217; sink her right where she stands, though that might get us
in Dutch with our people, since the rum-runners could come around an&#8217;
salvage this case stuff again. Only way to settle the puzzle&#8217;d be for us
to have a bargain day sale, opening case after case, knockin&#8217; the neck off
each and every bottle and makin&#8217; all the fish in this corner o&#8217; the
gulf dizzy with a mixture o&#8217; rum an&#8217; seawater.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack laughed at hearing all this wild stuff come from the bewildered
Perk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strikes me I&#8217;m not going to get much satisfaction from you,
partner,&#8221; he bluntly told the other. &#8220;Our folks expect to see some
evidence to prove the big yarn we&#8217;re bound to tell&#8211;about our
dropping those tear bombs and scattering the fighting hijackers and rum-runners
and all that stuff which means that by hook or by crook we&#8217;ve just
<i>got</i> to get clear with this sloop and all the contraband that&#8217;s
aboard&#8211;hand it over to some of Uncle Sam&#8217;s agents along the gulf
coast, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span> whose
addresses I was given before leaving Washington, to be used in just such
circumstances as these. So try again, and see if you can suggest some way it can
be put through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Perk started scratching his tousled head in a fashion he always
followed when given a problem to solve, since his wits were apt to be a bit
rusty and in need of oiling so as to cause them to function properly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that jar you?&#8221; he finally exploded, &#8220;we
jest can&#8217;t load our crate with the bally stuff, &#8217;cause it couldn&#8217;t
lift a tenth o&#8217; the cargo we grabbed so easy-like. An&#8217; as to
towin&#8217; the sloop after us by a hawser, it&#8217;d be too much like a
caterpiller creepin&#8217; along. I own up it&#8217;s got me buffaloed. Jack,
an&#8217; if anything&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be done it&#8217;s bound to come
out o&#8217; your own coco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No hurry at all, brother,&#8221; the other told him, little chance of
those lads making back this way in a hurry, since they got the scare of their
lives tonight. &#8220;Let&#8217;s look around some more and possibly a
suggestion will pop up to give us the glad hand and see us out of the
mire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suits me okay old hoss,&#8221; agreed Perk, nodding his head
confidently as though he had known all along that such a clever partner as Jack
would have a spare card up his sleeve to play when things began to look
unusually gloomy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>Perk picked up one
of the lanterns, for he knew they would need some sort of illumination if they
intended to explore the regions below deck which he termed the
&#8220;hold,&#8221; not being much of a sea-going man, although capable of
filling quite a number of different callings from engineer to air pilot.</p>

<p>He had not taken half a dozen steps after descending the short flight of
steps leading below when he came to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory be! what was that?&#8211;sounded real like a groan, Jack!&#8221;
he exclaimed, trying to peer into the gloom of the hold, where there seemed to
be row after row of the same type of wooden cases with foreign inscriptions
burned on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what it was, Perk,&#8221; agreed his chum, pressing close behind
the holder of the lantern, &#8220;lift the light a bit, I think I can make out
something stretched out flat&#8211;yes, it must be a man, I&#8217;m
certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kinder guessed we&#8217;d run across one or two o&#8217; the scrappers
knocked out an&#8217; left behind in the getaway rush,&#8221; commented Perk who
had drawn his automatic before starting to explore the lower regions of the
rum-runner, not knowing what they were apt to meet there.</p>

<p>He continued to advance, and presently they were bending over a dismal
looking object, undoubtedly a man who might be a member of the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span> crew, judging from his
rough sea clothes and his bare feet.</p>

<p>There could be no question but that he had been in the fight, since his face
was bloody and his general appearance betokened rough treatment. Undoubtedly he
had been senseless at the time the tear-gas penetrated every part of the small
vessel, and was only now coming to.</p>

<p>Jack lost no time in examining the pitiful looking object while Perk waited
to hear what his verdict would be. After all the old fighter bore no malice
toward any of these reckless men who were so assiduously engaged in breaking the
law of the land by running contraband goods into Uncle Sam&#8217;s domains and
he was just as willing to bind up the wounds of this luckless adventurer as if
the other had only been an ordinary sailor in sore trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing serious, it seems,&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s decision. &#8220;He
has had a pretty hard knock that started the blood from his nose and as like as
not laid him out here senseless for there&#8217;s a fine big lump on his
head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ll have <i>one</i> prisoner to fetch in after all,&#8221;
chortled Perk, as if pleased by the prospect of being able to produce a witness
to testify to the work they had just accomplished.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SPOILS OF VICTORY</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Take hold, Perk,&#8221; continued Jack, without losing any time.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get this poor chap out in the open air for it&#8217;s
pretty bad down below here, and bothers my eyes more or less.&#8221;</p>

<p>So between them they managed to carry the wounded rum-runner to the deck,
where he was laid down, still groaning, although showing no other signs of
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step lively, brother, and see if you can run across any fresh water,
so&#8217;s to pour a little down his throat,&#8221; Jack went on to say.
&#8220;I can dip up some salty stuff by reaching down over the gun&#8217;l and mop his
forehead so&#8217;s to fetch him around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, boss!&#8221; snapped the ever ready Perk, &#8220;kinder guess I
spied a barrel with a faucet&#8211;hope now she don&#8217;t hold spirits instead
o&#8217; water. Watch my smoke, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was indeed back in what he would term a &#8220;jiffy,&#8221; bearing a
battered and rusty tin kettle in his hand which proved to contain something that
might, with reservations, be called &#8220;drinking&#8221; water though it
proved to be lukewarm and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_75'></a>75</span> possibly full of &#8220;wigglers,&#8221; as the
larvae of mosquitoes are called.</p>

<p>Jack raised the man&#8217;s head, which he had succeeded in washing to some
extent, and forcing open his mouth allowed some of the contents of the pannikin
to drain down his throat.</p>

<p>This set him to coughing and so he came to, showing all the signs of
bewilderment that might be expected after going to sleep in the midst of a most
clamorous battle with the reckless hijackers, and now waking up to find strange
faces bending over him, heads that were encased in close-fitting helmets and the
staring goggles of airmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, brother,&#8221; Jack assured the man, on
seeing how alarmed he appeared to be. &#8220;Your crew skipped out and deserted
you, but we&#8217;ll stand by. Consider yourself a prisoner of Uncle Sam,
although you&#8217;ll not be punished any to speak of if only you open up and
tell all you know about the owners and the skipper of this smuggler craft.
What&#8217;s her name and where are you from?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man had by this time recovered sufficiently to understand what was
required of him. Jack&#8217;s manner was reassuring, and he came out of his half
panic so as to make quite a civil reply to the questions asked.</p>

<p>So they learned that the sloop had been known <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span> as the <i>Cicade</i>, which Jack knew to
mean a locust and that her home port was in the Bahamas, hot-bed of the smuggler
league, Bimini, in fact, being its chief port of departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re we goin&#8217; to do with this chap?&#8221; Perk was
asking. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want him to give us the slip, since he&#8217;s the
on&#8217;y prisoner we got, do we, partner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon not, brother, and to make certain that doesn&#8217;t happen
we&#8217;ll have to tie him up or fasten him to the mast here while we finish
looking around. I hope to run across the ship&#8217;s papers, if they&#8217;ve
got any such things aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave that to me, Jack, I&#8217;m some punkins when it comes to
splicin&#8217; up a prisoner o&#8217; war, so he can&#8217;t break away.&#8221;
Perk proved himself a man of his word by securing a piece of rope, wrapping it
several times around the ankles of the seaman, and finishing with a succession
of hard knots such as would require the services of a sharp knife blade when it
came time to liberate the captive.</p>

<p>The man was a pretty tough looking customer, thanks to the treatment he had
met with in the merry time the rival parties had had aboard the sloop, but at
least he knew when he was well off and something in Jack&#8217;s manner as well
as his voice told him these strangers would go easy <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> him if only he gave them as little
trouble as possible.</p>

<p>So once again the pair set out to finish their exploration of the object of
their latest &#8220;strafing&#8221; feat when a battle had been brought to an
abrupt close with all hands in full flight simply by a dextrous movement of
Perk&#8217;s arm and the tossing of a couple of innocent looking tear-bombs into
the midst of the warring factions.</p>

<p>This time it was Jack who made the discovery. Perk saw him step over, while
they were still on deck, and lift a ragged tarpaulin that seemed to cover some
bulky object toward the stern of the sloop. After that one look Jack gave the
well-worn covering a hitch and a toss that sent it flying revealing something
that caused Perk&#8217;s eyes to stick out with astonishment, not mentioning a
sudden spasm of delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! what&#8217;s this I&#8217;m seein&#8217; partner?&#8221; he
yelped joyously. &#8220;A reg&#8217;lar engine or I&#8217;m a crocodile from the Nile!
Why, this must be what they call an auxiliary craft, fitted to use canvas or
hoss power, whichever fills the bill best. You c&#8217;n ditch me if this ain&#8217;t
what I&#8217;ll call luck. An&#8217; heaps of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a sneaking suspicion we&#8217;d run across something like
this,&#8221; confessed Jack, who nevertheless seemed just as well pleased as his
comrade over the find. &#8220;It&#8217;s taking too big a chance <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span> to ship a cargo as rich as
this one in a tub like this with only rotten sails to speed the craft if she
happened to run afoul of a revenue cutter or one of those new sub-chasers the
Coast Guard&#8217;s been fitted out with. And now the problem&#8217;s been
solved, just as we hoped it would be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; we c&#8217;n get somewhere without tryin&#8217; to tow the
rum-boat behind our crate, and making a long and tiresome job o&#8217; it, eh
what, partner?&#8221; Perk suggested, with considerable animation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a look at this engine, Perk, and tell me if you reckon you could
run the thing if it became necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly the other investigated and it was not long before he ventured to
give his decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems okay to me, Boss. Course I can&#8217;t jest say for sure till I
tries it out, but the chances are three to one she&#8217;ll work for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon have a chance to put that to the test, for it&#8217;s
our only way to hang on to our spoils and have something to turn in for the
night&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m laughin&#8217; to see how things keep happenin&#8217; jest
to suit our crowd, old hoss,&#8221; Perk went on to remark, still chuckling at a
great rate. &#8220;Do we tow the ship behind the sloop, partner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that you could notice,&#8221; he was informed. &#8220;I aim to
have you stick to the rummy, while I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_79'></a>79</span> get up a thousand feet or so and kind of play the
part of an aerial scout, just like you&#8217;ve told me you used to do when you
were running one of those war sausages, known as blimps in these up-to-date
times. No objections, have you, Perk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, me? I should guess not,&#8221; the other exploded. &#8220;Why,
it&#8217;ll be jest a rummy time with this kid, runnin&#8217; off with the old
sloop and a prisoner on board to boot. I&#8217;m tickled pink to know
we&#8217;re right in action at last, after waitin&#8217; so long, an&#8217;
ding-dongin&#8217; around till we both got stale. But how &#8217;bout
draggin&#8217; that ere mudhook up off the ground&#8211;think we c&#8217;n tackle the
job between us, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! That can be put through without much trouble, I reckon,&#8221;
Perk was assured by the confident one. &#8220;I think if you investigate
you&#8217;ll find they&#8217;ve got some sort of winch, a bit like the
old-fashioned windlass we used to wind up whenever we pulled the old oaken
bucket up from the country well. Let&#8217;s take a peek and make
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took them but a minute to have Jack&#8217;s guess verified, for there was
a winch, with the rope of the anchor attached; all that would be necessary was
to start winding and by main strength the anchor must be hauled out of the mud
and lifted to the vessel&#8217;s bow, there to hang until needed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use of our stickin&#8217; &#8217;round these diggin&#8217;s <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span> any longer,
partner,&#8221; Perk suggested. &#8220;The canvas is all clewed up or reefed,
whatever they call it, so we won&#8217;t have it flappin&#8217; around after the
ship gets under way. Say the word, Boss, an&#8217; leave the rest to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But nothing has been said as to what port we&#8217;re meaning to
strike out for,&#8221; observed Jack, &#8220;and that&#8217;s a matter of
considerable importance. First of all it would be apt to queer our business some
if we sailed openly into Tampa, St. Petersburg, or even Key West; for some of
those smart newspaper reporters would be bound to get on to the facts and like
as not we&#8217;d have our pictures printed in all the papers. A fat chance
we&#8217;d stand to do any more work ripping this contraband conspiracy up the
back, after <i>they</i> got through telling things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess now that would queer our game, wouldn&#8217;t it,
partner?&#8221; bleated the annoyed Perk, then brightening up as he eyed his
chum in a suggestive fashion as though anticipating further interesting remarks
along that particular line, he went on to add: &#8220;S&#8217;pose I&#8217;m let into
the plan I know you&#8217;ve got all fixed up for us to foller.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All things considered,&#8221; began Jack, thus urged, &#8220;I reckon
it would be the best scheme if we managed to get the rum-runner anchored back in
that big bunch of mangrove islands on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_81'></a>81</span> the outer edge of which we lay low with our crate so
nicely camouflaged. For that matter we could cover the deck the same way, since
it&#8217;ll be from the air most likely the danger is bound to
come&#8211;through Oscar Gleeb, the German ex-war pilot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds good to me, buddy!&#8221; snapped Perk, grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll swing around overhead, and have my eye peeled for any sign
of trouble,&#8221; continued Jack, &#8220;and also keep tabs on you while on the
trip south. Of course we don&#8217;t know just what speed you can coax out of
that rusty old engine, but even at a minimum of six or eight miles per hour, we
surely ought to get in hiding before sun-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough, Boss, and mebbe long before,&#8221; Perk agreed.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you get the far away grumble of a marine engine working just
when we climbed aboard this junk&#8211;I didn&#8217;t say anything at the time,
but I guessed as how it might be that second tub turnin&#8217; tail an&#8217;
puttin&#8217; for the shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made up my mind that was what it stood for,&#8221; Jack told his
companion. &#8220;They listened to all that terrible racket and just made up
their minds it was too hot out this way for them to make the riffle. Oh, well!
two may be company, but three&#8217;s considered a crowd and we might <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> have found we&#8217;d
bitten off more than we could chew, so what does it matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve gathered in the booze,&#8221; Perk was saying proudly,
&#8220;or most of it anyway, together with the rum-runner, and one o&#8217; the
crew to turn State&#8217;s evidence, so what else could we wish for&#8211;I for
one don&#8217;t feel greedy. Plenty more where this one came from, and the
smuggling season is long. What we got to pay most attention to is liftin&#8217;
the lid, so&#8217;s to find out just who the big guns are, backing this racket
an&#8217; chances are we&#8217;re on the right road to doin&#8217; that this
very minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s correct, Perk, but let&#8217;s get a move on and be
going.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>ENGINEER PERK ON DECK</span></h2>

<p>Everything else being in readiness Jack and his muscular comrade started to
work the deck winch in order to get the anchor &#8220;apeak,&#8221; as Perk
called it, being desirous of showing off with his limited knowledge of things
nautical.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s amovin&#8217; okay, old hoss!&#8221; gasped Perk who had
been doing considerable straining, anxious to display his ability as a mudhook
lifter. &#8220;A few more good pulls an&#8217; we&#8217;ll have the old gink
where we want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The task being completed, the sloop began to move backward, very much like
those fiddler crabs Perk had watched retreating before his attack on one of the
sandy Florida beaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like I&#8217;d better go aboard our ship and get away from here
before anything happens to disable a wing,&#8221; Jack hastened to remark,
sensing possible trouble which would be in the nature of a serious calamity just
then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it then, matey,&#8221; Perk told him, light-heartedly enough,
&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to do my stuff as a half-cooked engineer. Don&#8217;t
worry a bit about <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span> my
gettin&#8217; there with both feet if the bally motor only holds together.
Don&#8217;t like its looks any too much, but then Lady Luck seems to be
givin&#8217; us a heap o&#8217; favors, so we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to finish
after the Garrison style&#8211;heavy on the home stretch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Perk reached the last word his chum had gained his seat in the
cubbyhole of the amphibian, and almost immediately called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut that rope and let me get away, partner&#8211;hurry up before I get
another and harder bump!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten seconds afterward the airship was entirely free from contact with the
drifting sloop. Then came the roar of the motor showing that Jack had given her
the gun. Instantly there was a forward movement of the amphibian, which
increased rapidly until it was rushing along with great speed presently lifting
its nose toward the heavens and leaving the rolling surface of the gulf, soared
aloft in repeated circles.</p>

<p>Perk, after seeing that his pal was well on his way, turned his attention to
his own job. He had no particular trouble in coaxing the engine to start,
although it did considerable &#8220;grunting&#8221; as though its joints might
be rusty and in need of lubricating oil, thus telling that the late skipper had
allowed his engineer to neglect his duties in a climate where the salt in the
air always rusted the inside of gun barrels, machinery of all <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span> descriptions, and in many
ways played havoc with exposed metal parts.</p>

<p>However, after the engine got well warmed up it began to work more smoothly
so that Perk lost some of his first anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to get along okay I guess,&#8221; he assured himself and
then, keeping the prow of his vessel headed due south, he found time to try and
discover where Jack and his soaring crate might be.</p>

<p>The engine was a gas motor and well supplied with an abundance of fuel, since
the winds on their recent voyage around the Florida Keys must have been
favorable as a whole and with the motive power idle there had been no drain on
the gas.</p>

<p>Perk was feeling prime at that particular moment in his checkered career. It
afforded him much pride to thus be in sole charge of a captured rum-runner with
a cargo of contraband aboard. Then, too, all doubts concerning his ability to
serve as an engineer were already dissipated for the sloop was making fair time
and carried a bone in her teeth, as the white lines of foam running out on
either side attested.</p>

<p>Perk was softly singing to himself some marine ditty he had picked up in the
course of his adventurous life afloat and ashore and which had for a title
&#8220;Rolling Down to Old Mohea&#8221;&#8211;it thrilled him to the core to
feel that he was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
luckily able to afford Jack just the assistance the other required so as to
perfect his plan of campaign.</p>

<p>Now he believed he could glimpse the amphibian overhead&#8211;yes, the moon,
poking her nose out from behind a bank of clouds, allowed him to make
certain&#8211;Jack had swung back and was circling, so as to keep the sloop
within range of his vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like a guardeen angel,&#8221; mused the enraptured Perk, standing
at his post and sending frequent curious as well as proud glances aloft,
&#8220;as he told me he meant to be. Say, ain&#8217;t this simply great stuff
we&#8217;ve struck?&#8211;never felt so joyous in all my life as when I smashed
them two tear-bombs down on the deck here an&#8217; busted up that
fightin&#8217; mob. Zowie! how quick they got a move on, every single man but
the one lone dickey we found knocked out down below-stairs. Ev&#8217;rything
movin&#8217; along like silk&#8211;who cares whether school keeps or not, with
us boys on the top wave o&#8217; success.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he concluded to stop premature boasting, knowing very well that as in a
game of baseball nothing is settled until the last man has been put out.</p>

<p>So the voyage down the coast continued steadily enough, the minutes running
along into <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span> hours,
with faithful Perk keeping steadfastly at his new job.</p>

<p>From time to time he would find the plane hovering directly over his head,
and was able to catch certain signals which he could understand because of a
previous arrangement he and Jack had.</p>

<p>Although the moving sloop was not over a mile or so from the shore line, it
was next to impossible for Perk to catch a fleeting glimpse of land, so as to
get his bearings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; he told himself at one time after he had received
instructions to draw a bit further toward the open gulf, as he was approaching
some point of land jutting into the water, and thus making a shoal possibly
covered with coon-oysters, on which he was apt to pull up hurriedly with
disastrous results, &#8220;this here is like flyin&#8217; blind at a five
thousand-foot ceilin&#8217;,&#8211;Jack, he c&#8217;n see the land by usin&#8217; the
night glasses, so it&#8217;s a good thing I c&#8217;n get tips from him right along.
Gee! this sure is gettin&#8217; some monotonous, keepin&#8217; this old motor
hummin&#8217; when it&#8217;s on the blink so bad. Must be a wheen past
midnight, I&#8217;d say, an&#8217; we ought to be clost to them Ten Thousand
Islands by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been keeping close watch on the stars and although making no claims to
being a first-class woodsman, Perk could tell the time of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span> night by the heavenly bodies setting one
after another, which would account for his late confident assertion that morning
could not be so very far distant.</p>

<p>Once only during all this time did Perk happen to see a far distant light out
at sea. It interested him more or less and naturally caused him to speculate as
to whether it might have any connection with the great game in which he and Jack
were now engaged. Everything he had ever heard or read connected with the
Mexican Gulf seemed to pass in review through his active mind&#8211;there was a
halo of romance hovering about that historical sheet of salt water and while
Perk was not much given to flights of fancy, he found himself picturing some of
the thrilling scenes he had recently read about, after learning that the next
locality in which he and Jack would play their adventurous part was along the
Florida Gulf Coast.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly found himself listening intently, for above the pounding of
the old motor, with an occasional &#8220;miss&#8221; to break the monotony, he
fancied he had caught the signal Jack was to give him when the time arrived for
making a turn toward the coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully boy, Jack!&#8221; Perk cried out when he found that he had not
been deceived. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be right pleased to drop this tiresome job
an&#8217; think <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
myself some lucky to miss havin&#8217; the tub run on a reef, or the bally motor
kickin&#8217; off an&#8217; quittin&#8217; cold. Yes, an&#8217; there&#8217;s
what looks like a bunch o&#8217; cabbage palms stickin&#8217; their tops against
the sky-line. Better slow up, Perk, old scout, afore you hit some stump or get
aground off shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he throttled the motor a bit and fairly crept along. He even found himself
wishing he had fixed things so that the prisoner might stand by with a sounding
pole in the bow of the sloop to sing out the depth and give warning of sudden
shallows but it was too late now to attempt such a thing, even if he had dared
take the chance of the fellow jumping overboard and either drowning or getting
ashore to give warning as to the menace hovering above the operations of the
far-flung smuggler combine.</p>

<p>But fortune was still kind and presently Perk found himself softly gliding
past the outermost mangrove islands. Here, he remembered, it was his duty to
come about and lay to until Jack could drop down and taxi over to where the
sloop lay so as to consider their further plans in the coming dawn.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>TAMPA BOUND</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Congrats, Perk,&#8221; said Jack, as soon as he came close enough,
&#8220;you did the thing up in first-class shape. If all other jobs went back on
you I reckon you could get your papers along the engineering line. A bit tired
in the bargain I take it, partner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lay off on that stuff, matey,&#8221; replied the other, scornfully,
&#8220;me, I never get what you&#8217;d call tired, but jest the same I&#8217;m
right glad it&#8217;s all over an&#8217; the rotten crate didn&#8217;t get sunk
out there&#8211;hate to lose all this bottled juice we come by in such a queer
way. Climb aboard, Jack, an&#8217; let&#8217;s have a little talk-fest while we
rest up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Later on I&#8217;d be glad to do that,&#8221; he was told.
&#8220;We&#8217;d be wise to push further in among these islands before morning
comes along if any sponger or fisherman happened to glimpse this pair of odd sea
and air craft he&#8217;d spread the story far and wide and get us in Dutch.
I&#8217;ll fasten a tow line on to the ship here, if you&#8217;ll toss me a coil
and taxi away back where there <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_91'></a>91</span> wouldn&#8217;t be one chance in a thousand of our
being seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get you, buddy,&#8221; Perk hastened to say, as he made ready to
toss the bight of stout rope to his waiting chum, &#8220;and it&#8217;s all to
the good with me. Dandy luck we&#8217;ve been havin&#8217; for a fact, on&#8217;y hope
it keeps on that way to the finish line. Here you are, Boss!&#8221;</p>

<p>After Jack had made the small hawser fast he started the taxi stunt and
presently they were moving past the outlying clumps of mangroves with never a
bit of trouble. Perk made himself comfortable by throwing his really fatigued
form flat on the deck and stretching his muscles to the limit.</p>

<p>This continued for some little time until finally Jack shut off his power and
came alongside, ready to climb aboard the sloop.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll tie her up to this nearby clump of mangroves, where
you&#8217;ll notice there&#8217;s a bunch of tall palmetto trees growing,
showing there must be ground, such as few of these islands can boast. I&#8217;m
picking this place especially because those cabbage palms will keep the mast of
the sloop from sticking up and betraying its location to any flyer passing
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d call that a mighty fine idea, partner,&#8221; declared Perk
enthusiastically. &#8220;Never would athought o&#8217; anything like that
myself&#8211;my old <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
bean don&#8217;t work along them lines I guess. An&#8217; when I&#8217;ve done
that camouflage act again nobody ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to spy out a single
thing down this-aways. Great work, if I do say it myself, Jack old
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had managed to fasten the bow of the sloop to one of the palmetto
trees, Jack crawled aboard. He must have also felt more or less tired, after
being caged in the small confines of the cockpit so long, for he followed
Perk&#8217;s example and dropped down on the deck to stretch out while they
exchanged opinions.</p>

<p>&#8220;None too soon for our safety,&#8221; was the first remark Jack made,
&#8220;see, there in the east the sky has begun to take on a faint rosy tint
which means the sun must be making ready to rise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Things are workin&#8217; just lovely for us, I&#8217;d mention, old
hoss,&#8221; suggested Perk, with one of his good-humored chuckles that told how
well pleased he must be on account of the many &#8220;breaks&#8221; that
persisted in coming their way. &#8220;Let the mornin&#8217; come along when it
pleases, it don&#8217;t matter a red cent to us back here in this gloomy
solitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>They started to exchange opinions concerning the remarkable happenings of the
night just passed and in this way many things that had not been very clear to
Perk were made plain. On his part he was able to offer several suggestions that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span> added to the stock
of knowledge Jack already possessed so that it was a mutual affair after
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather reckon somebody&#8217;s going to get a surprise packet when I
finish explaining just how this contraband sloop and cargo fell into our
hands,&#8221; Jack was saying at one time, apparently vastly amused himself.
&#8220;Fact is, I wouldn&#8217;t blame the Commissioner for believing I was
drawing the long bow when he hears about those tear-bombs you tossed out that
scattered the crowd like I&#8217;ve heard you tell a shell used to do when it
dropped into a dugout over in the Argonne.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they lay there taking things easy, the heavens in the east assumed a most
wonderful range of various delicate tints that made even Perk gasp with
admiration. Birds started singing, mocking birds and cardinals among others,
crows could be heard cawing close by as though there might be a hidden bird
roost not far distant. This was corroborated later on when streams of white
egrets flew past, scattering to find their morning meal.</p>

<p>So, too, circling buzzards could be seen far above as they searched for signs
of a feast in the shape of a dead fish cast ashore on some sandbar or
mudbank&#8211;a heavy plunge not far away told of a monster alligator that had
been lying asleep on some log, taking a dive as he noticed the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span> presence of two-legged
human enemies whom he had reason to suspect of designs on his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about a little grub for a change, partner?&#8221; demanded Perk,
after they had been talking for quite some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon it wouldn&#8217;t come amiss,&#8221; admitted Jack;
&#8220;but if you&#8217;ve got any idea of starting a fire and making coffee,
better throw that overboard right away, for in the first place you&#8217;d find
it a hard job to run across any solid ground among all these mangrove islands
and then besides it might not be the wisest thing going to send up a column of
smoke to attract attention to this quarter. Get that do you, Perk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&#8211;es,&#8221; admitted the other, with a disconsolate shrug of
his shoulders as if he had no liking for the scheme being thus tabooed,
&#8220;s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s jest like you put it, Jack, though I own up I was
hopin&#8217; we might make a pot o&#8217; coffee. Just the same we got plenty
o&#8217; fresh water along, even if it is sorter warm an&#8217; coffee&#8217;d
taste just prime, but I c&#8217;n stand anything when necessity drives. So let&#8217;s
get our teeth in some eats without botherin&#8217; further, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m
half starved an&#8217; them sandwiches&#8217;d go fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly they started operations, Perk clambering aboard the amphibian to
fish out the package of &#8220;eats&#8221;, he knowing best where it had <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span> been secreted on the
previous evening after they had supper near this same spot.</p>

<p>As they munched their dry food they continued to talk, finding plenty of
subjects bearing on their work that would be the better for further study.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one way we can arrange things so as to keep our
clutch on the spoils we&#8217;ve rustled so far and do our duty according to
orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I kinder guess I c&#8217;n smell a rat already, Jack,&#8221; chuckled Perk
as he wrapped up the remnant of the food supply which he had taken from their
main stock&#8211;&#8220;I&#8217;m the goat in the deal&#8211;you figger on me
stayin&#8217; here in this &#8217;gator hole to stand by the ship an&#8217; knock the
block off&#8217;n anybody what tries to get away with our property&#8211;how&#8217;s
that for a straight hit square in the bullseye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go up head, Perkiser&#8211;you got the answer first clip, for
that&#8217;s just what has to be put through. I&#8217;ll start off presently and
make a bee line for Tampa where they told me our immediate boss, Colonel
Tranter, is stopping with his sick wife. I&#8217;ll make my report direct to him
and take further orders. He&#8217;ll like enough detail a couple of revenue men
on duty along the East Coast to come back with me to where you&#8217;re lying
here so they can take the sloop and her wet <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_96'></a>96</span> cargo to Tampa to be given over to the proper
officers who will see that no clever smuggler has half a chance to run away with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I c&#8217;n easy enough see how you&#8217;ve thunk ev&#8217;ry thing out,
an&#8217; on&#8217;y need a little time to put the scheme through with a rush. Tell
me, Jack, will you be apt to get any further lines on the way things stand down
here?&#8211;there was some talk, I &#8217;member, about them bein&#8217; able to give
us a few pointers concernin&#8217; them higher-ups the Government is so anxious
to cage so as to break this whole gang up for keeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I intend to ask about that very thing,&#8221; came
Jack&#8217;s ready reply, &#8220;and I&#8217;m also in great hopes they&#8217;ll
be able to add some news worth while, that, in conjunction with what we already
know, or suspect, will put us sleuth hounds on the hot trail of the big
millionaire they feel certain has been the main backing of the whole ugly bunch
while keeping in the background himself all the while. They&#8217;re depending
on you and me, Perk, to produce the evidence that&#8217;s going to convict him
of conspiracy against the Government, which may send him to Atlanta for a dozen
years or more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know how long you&#8217;ll be away, Jack?&#8221; demanded the other
casually as if it was really a matter of but little moment to him what the
answer might be, since he could be depended on to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span> hold to their booty with the tenacity of
a leech.</p>

<p>&#8220;That all depends on circumstances&#8211;I may be back by noon, and
again not till late in the afternoon or evening. I expect to fetch a couple of
sandbaggers along who will take over the sloop and stuff that&#8217;s aboard.
Having washed our hands clean of those encumbrances we&#8217;ll be in fit shape
to delve deeper into the game and see what we get out of the grab-bag. Anyway,
don&#8217;t expect me until you see me heading this way and keep a sharp
lookout, for from all accounts this crowd we&#8217;re up against is said to be a
tricky combination, always stepping on their toes and doing big
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ve heard lots o&#8217; that kind o&#8217; stuff but
just the same the lads makin&#8217; up the crew o&#8217; this sloop didn&#8217;t
keep their eyes open, or they&#8217;d never been taken unawares by them
hijackers. Leave it to Gabe Perkiser to hold fast to what he&#8217;s got;
they&#8217;d have to be a regiment, armed with machine-guns, bombs, an&#8217;
even gas, to knock <i>me</i> off&#8217;n my perch an&#8217; I don&#8217;t mean that
for boastin&#8217; either, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later on Jack decided it would be just as well for him to jump off and be on
his way to Tampa. Contrary winds or something else might delay his arrival, and
an early start was bound to be of much help toward bringing a quick return.</p>

<p>He first used the binoculars in order to scan <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span> the heavens as well as they could be
covered when he was so surrounded by those strange mangrove islands and
discovering no sign of any cruising, spying crate, he bade Perk goodbye and
taxied in the direction of the open gulf, which he knew lay due west.</p>

<p>Perk answered his signal ere the amphibian turned a bend in the tortuous
channel and saw Jack vanish from view; nor could he long detect any sound to
indicate the presence of an airship since cautious Jack had again made use of
that wonderful &#8220;silencer&#8221; which they had found so useful while
conducting their search during the preceding night. Then the appointed guardian
of the captured contraband sloop turned his attention to matters which had to do
with his making the tied-up craft as thoroughly invisible from the upper air as
he knew how.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>PERK HOLDS THE FORT</span></h2>

<p>First of all Perk set about getting the one boat that had been left aboard
the smuggler sloop into the water as he would need it for conveying his green
material with which he intended to cover the exposed deck.</p>

<p>There was little trouble about accomplishing that and when he dropped into
the rowboat with a pair of excellent oars in his possession, he felt
considerably encouraged.</p>

<p>So he started to poke around, hoping to run across some island that was more
than a mere patch of the omnipresent mangrove tangle. This he succeeded in doing
without much loss of time and his pleasure redoubled at finding a mass of dwarf
saw palmetto that would yield him a plentiful supply of fronds with their queer
serrated edges such as would stab cruelly unless one took care to handle them
properly.</p>

<p>Here, too, were some young palmetto trees with the new leaves within easy
reach. Working with a vim Perk speedily loaded his small boat with green stuff,
after which he returned to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_100'></a>100</span> the sloop and proceeded to scatter his material to
the best advantage all over any exposed part of the contraband vessel.</p>

<p>It necessitated a second trip before he felt satisfied for whatever his
shortcomings might be in other respects, Perk always tried to fulfill his whole
duty whenever he tackled a job.</p>

<p>By the time he had finished he was &#8220;reeking wet&#8221; as he called it,
with &#8220;honest-to-goodness sweat,&#8221; not perspiration, but it was worth
all it cost to be able to feel that the sharpest vision on the part of a sky
pilot passing over the spot, and even equipped with powerful binoculars, would
not be able to detect the presence of the sequestered runaway sloop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; he told himself, as he lay down to rest a bit and
scan the blue heavens so as to learn whether there was any sign of a cloud
chaser from horizon to horizon where the clumps of mangroves allowed him a clear
vision.</p>

<p>Several times he gave a little start, and proceeded to strain his eyes so as
to make doubly sure, but in every instance the moving dot he had noted far away
to the north or nor&#8217;east proved to be a circling buzzard, keeping up his eternal
weaving to and fro in search of a belated breakfast after his own peculiar
kind.</p>

<p>So the time passed, and Perk even dozed, lying there amidst his &#8220;Palm
Sunday greens,&#8221; as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_101'></a>101</span> he fancifully called the camouflage stuff, for the
climbing sun kept getting warmer, and induced somnolence, especially after such
an eventful night as the one he and Jack had just passed.</p>

<p>Later in the morning he sat up, took another cautious look around at the
clear sky, and then proceeded to enjoy a good, old-fashioned smoke, for Perk was
a lover of his under-slung pipe <i>a la Dawes</i>.</p>

<p>Noon found him thus, picturing his chum arriving at Tampa and interviewing
the Government official who could give him what assistance he required so as to
turn over the captured sloop and the contraband it carried, both above and below
decks.</p>

<p>At one time Perk out of curiosity&#8211;as well as a desire to be in a
condition to state the amount of spoils he and Jack had &#8220;corraled&#8221;
in their swoop upon the fighting smugglers and hijackers&#8211;took a pad of
paper and a pencil and proceeded to go over the entire vessel, securing a rough
invoice of the numerous piled-up cases bearing that foreign, burnt brand.</p>

<p>Then a temptation gripped him, and, as he took another &#8220;eyeful&#8221;
sweep of the azure arch overhead, to again find the coast clear, he tortured
himself with the vision of a pot of boiling coffee to go with his otherwise dry
midday snack of lunch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>&#8220;Huh! no
use talkin&#8217;, I jest <i>can&#8217;t</i> stand it any longer&#8211;got to
have my coffee if I want to keep happy as a clam at high tide. Nothin&#8217; to
prevent me paddlin&#8217; across once more to where I got these here greens. I
noticed heaps an&#8217; heaps o&#8217; dry wood, broken branches, stems o&#8217;
palmetto leaves an&#8217; such dandy trash for a quick fire. Might as well tote
the machine-gun along, so&#8217;s to be ready for anything that comes&#8211;it
could be a frisky twelve-foot &#8217;gator wantin&#8217; to climb me or mebbe one
o&#8217; them sly painters I been told they got down in this queer old country.
Anyway, here you go, Perk, coffee pot an&#8217; all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was soon busily engaged in building his little fire, hoping no hostile
eyes might detect the trailing smoke ascending above the tops of that palmetto
clump. Then came the pleasing task of watching his coffee pot as it stood on the
tilting firewood, a job that required constant vigilance if he hoped to save its
precious contents from spilling.</p>

<p>Presently the odor began to fill him with delight and later on he found
himself sitting cross-legged, like a Turk, and swallowing gulp after gulp of the
amber fluid he loved so well.</p>

<p>Taken altogether it proved to be as satisfactory a little lunch as Perk had
partaken of in some time. After finishing the entire contents of his coffee pot,
he concluded it would be just as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_103'></a>103</span> well for him to clean up, destroying all signs of
the fire, and return to the sloop.</p>

<p>He had good reason to shake hands with himself because of this exhibition of
caution, for later on, as the afternoon began to lengthen, with the sun starting
down toward the western horizon, he suddenly began to catch faint sounds such as
sent a sudden thrill through his whole nervous system.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dang it if I ain&#8217;t hearin&#8217; somethin&#8217; right like
human voices,&#8221; he told himself, cocking up his head the better to listen,
and applying a cupped hand to his right ear. &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s a fact,
an&#8217; over in that quarter to boot,&#8221; nodding toward the northeast
where his instinct told him the mainland must lie, even if some miles
distant.</p>

<p>So, too, he decided later that the suspicious sounds kept growing louder,
from which fact he judged the speakers were slowly but surely approaching his
hiding place.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, let &#8217;em come along,&#8221; Perk muttered grimly as he
clutched that deadly little hand machine-gun with which he could pour a rain of
missiles in a comparatively speedy passage of time. &#8220;They can&#8217;t
ditch me, I kinder guess, an&#8217; nobody ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to grab this
crate if I have to shoot up the hull mob o&#8217; galoots.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, since there was always a fair chance that the secreted sloop
might escape <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
discovery, Perk finally concluded to dispose of his own person, at the same time
meaning to keep in readiness to give the intruders a hot reception, did the
occasion warrant such a course.</p>

<p>Then he could hear what he knew to be the splash of oars, and squeaking
sounds of the row-locks. But he had already discounted this fact, knowing as he
did the impossibility of anyone ever reaching the fringe of that vast wilderness
of mangrove islands in which many a fisherman had been lost, never to find his
way out of the myriad of zigzag channels without the possession of some manner
of boat.</p>

<p>On they came until finally Perk realized they were just around the corner,
for he could pick up every word that was uttered as well as see specks of foam
from the working oars as it carried past, the tide being on the ebb just
then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Told yuh it was a steamer runnin&#8217; past thet sent up yer smoke
trail, Zeb,&#8221; a harsh jeering voice was saying, accompanying the words with
a string of oaths as though he felt more or less &#8220;mad&#8221; because of
the exertion necessitated in working at the oars so long and on a bootless
errand at that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall,&#8221; came another drawling voice in which keen disappointment
could be detected. &#8220;I judged it shore lay in this direction, but like yuh
says, it must&#8217;a ben a steamer out yonder on the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_105'></a>105</span> gulf&#8211;mebbe thet rev&#8217;nue boat they done tole
us to watch out fur er else some o&#8217; them spongers frum up Tarpon Springs
way. Anyhow, I got all I wants o&#8217; exercise so I move weuns call hit a day
an&#8217; get back to the shanty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, thet&#8217;s the best thing we kin do,&#8221; agreed the other,
with a snarl in his heavy voice, &#8220;we got heaps o&#8217; work ahead
tonight, if so be thet Fritz airpilot does drop over with his batch o&#8217;
yeller boys like weuns been told he&#8217;d do. I&#8217;d like tuh see the whole
caboodle o&#8217; Chinks dropped inter the middle o&#8217; the gulf, I hate
&#8217;em so, but thar&#8217;s good money in the game, we happens tuh know, Zeb,
which I jest caint hold back on nowhow. Les go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Greatly to the relief of the listening Perk he heard the sound of splashing
gradually recede until finally it died away completely. This gave him a feeling
bordering on relief, for while Perk was an old hand at the fighting game and
stood ready to give a good account of his ability to defend their prize; at the
same time he had no violent desire to open up on the two occupants of the unseen
rowboat nor yet was the idea of the sloop being discovered at all to his
taste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky lads you might count yourselves if on&#8217;y you knew how I was
layin&#8217; right here in ambush, ready to sink that boat an&#8217; make the
biggest sort o&#8217; a splash. An&#8217; I&#8217;m guessin&#8217; I got off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span> right smart
&#8217;bout that cookin&#8217; fire racket, come to think of it&#8211;might
a&#8217;spilled the beans all right, and made all sort o&#8217; trouble for our
crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talking in this fashion to himself, Perk again set about taking things
comfortably nor did he ever hear of that pair again. Still, he treasured up in
his mind what he had heard the man with the harsh voice say in connection with
the smuggling of unwelcome Chinese immigrants who were ready to pay so well for
an opportunity to beat the Government regulations in their eagerness to join the
foreign colony in Mott Street, New York City, where the vast majority of them
were bound. It would naturally interest Jack when he heard the news, although it
could hardly be considered startling, since they already knew full well this
sort of thing was being carried on by daring airplane pilots in the service of
the far-flung smuggling combine.</p>

<p>By now it was well past the middle of the afternoon. Light fleecy, white
clouds had been drifting up from the direction of the Dry Tortugas and Key West
but this far they did not look at all portentous, as though any kind of a storm
might be brewing. Perk hoped that would not turn out to be the case since they
had work planned for a part of the coming night, which would be greatly hampered
by unsettled weather.</p>

<p>Then, on making one of his habitual observations <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span> of the upper air, he discovered a
moving speck that he soon decided must be a plane heading in his direction. At
first Perk fancied it must be Jack on his way back, but later on he realized the
air craft bore a great resemblance to the Curtiss-Robin boat which they had
figured belonged to the Hun pilot, Oscar Gleeb.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ODDENEMIES FACE TO FACE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Je-ru-salem crickets!&#8221; Perk told himself as he stared, &#8220;I
do b&#8217;lieve that&#8217;s the same Curtiss-Robin crate we saw before, an&#8217;
making direct for this here section o&#8217; the map in the bargain! Now I
wonder what he wants to barge in for when things seem to be doin&#8217; their
prettiest for us fellers? Guess I&#8217;d better get ready for boarders. If that
smart guy took a notion to swoop down for a close-up o&#8217; these mangrove
islands, he&#8217;d be apt to pick me up, &#8217;specially if he happens to own a pair
o&#8217; glasses, which stands to reason he sure does. Huh! what a bother.
Better be slow &#8217;bout foolin&#8217; with a buzz-saw, that&#8217;s all I c&#8217;n
say to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sooner said than done, which was Perk&#8217;s usual way of playing the
game. He changed his position for one that offered less chance for discovery and
while about it Perk started to build up something in the shape of a formidable
fortification.</p>

<p>&#8220;What luck to have all these logs lyin&#8217; around when I need
them,&#8221; he went on to tell himself <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_109'></a>109</span> with many a dry chuckle. &#8220;Guess now they had
&#8217;em aboard to pull the wool over the eyes o&#8217; any customs men that
happened to board the sloop lookin&#8217; for contraband stuff&#8211;meant to
claim they was fetchin&#8217; mahogany logs to a States market. Gee whiz! they
sure are a tough proposition to move around but here&#8217;s the cutest little
fort any playboy could wish for. Let him come along&#8211;who cares a red cent
what he does, so long&#8217;s I got this here machine-gun with plenty o&#8217;
cartridges in the belts to riddle things with. Ring up the curtain, an&#8217;
let the play start. Makes me think I&#8217;m back in the old line again along
the Argonne, an&#8217; say, jest &#8217;magine how it all works out with one o&#8217;
them same Hun pilots swooping down on me! It sure is to laugh, boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the oncoming plane was drawing perilously near and Perk wisely
settled himself so that he could see all that occurred.</p>

<p>He possessed a pair of marvelously keen eyes and while it would have
simplified matters considerably had he been handling those wonderful binoculars,
just the same he could get on without them.</p>

<p>By close application he was able to see a figure bending over the ledge of
the cabin window, apparently scrutinizing the queer combination of mangrove
patches and crooked water passages between. The plane was rushing down a steep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span> slant in a clever
dive, or glide, so that with the passage of each second the chances for the
pilot to make a discovery increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh! but ain&#8217;t this the life, though?&#8221; muttered the
watcher, thrilled to the core with what was hovering over his head yet not so
much as making the slightest movement that would attract attention. If discovery
must come, Perk was determined that no act of his would hasten it along and no
responsibility for the tragedy&#8211;if such there followed&#8211;could be laid
at his door.</p>

<p>He had discovered some time back that the rival crate resembled their own, in
that it was in the amphibian class&#8211;could hop-off either from the land or
when on the water.</p>

<p>Really he had taken it for granted that such would turn out to be the case,
since occasions without number must arise when, for instance, the smugglers
wished to take alien Chinamen from some schooner or speedboat by means of which
the first part of their journey to the Promised Land had been carried through,
when it would be necessary for the plane to drop alongside the boat from Cuba or
other foreign ports and make the transfer.</p>

<p>The prospect was far from displeasing to Perk&#8211;he felt positive that it
would be the first time on record when one of Uncle Sam&#8217;s Secret <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span> Service men fought it
out with a taxiing seaplane on the subtropical waters of the great gulf.</p>

<p>The outcome of course was hidden behind a haze of mystery&#8211;one, or both
of those engaged might never live to tell the story but then that sort of
uncertainty had been his daily portion during his thrilling service on the
French front and its coming to the surface again after all these years of less
arduous labor only made Perk hug himself, theoretically speaking.</p>

<p>Now the flying ship was passing directly over his place of concealment,
although at rather a high ceiling. Would the Argus-eyed pilot make any
suspicious discovery, or, failing to do so, continue his scrutiny along the many
leagues of similar mangrove islands stretching far into the south?</p>

<p>Perk saw him pass the spot, which caused him to imagine the game was all off,
and he would have nothing but his trouble for his pains. Indeed a sense of heavy
disappointment had even begun to grip his heart when he saw the other suddenly
bank and swing as though meaning to come back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zowie! kinder looks like he <i>did</i> glimpse somethin&#8217; that
struck him as wuth a second scrutiny,&#8221; chuckled the anxious watcher, that
delicious thrill once more sweeping over his whole frame.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>Indeed, it was a
moment of more or less suspense, although Perk was telling himself he did not
care a particle whether the smuggler pilot discovered the mast of the sloop,
with its camouflaged deck below or not.</p>

<p>He was only hoping that the other might not take a notion to fly overhead and
try to drop some sort of a miserable bomb down upon the spot where things looked
a bit suspicious to him. Possibly Perk still seemed to get a faint whiff of the
tear-gas that had drenched the smugglers&#8217; boat at the time he himself
hurled those two bombs with such deadly accuracy and the possibility of being
himself made the target of a similar attack was anything but pleasing for him to
contemplate.</p>

<p>This time the Curtiss-Robin sped past not much more than three hundred feet
above, so that he could plainly make out a head, with its protecting helmet,
earflaps, and goggles, that was projected from the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darn his nerve, if he ain&#8217;t wavin&#8217; his hand to me to say,
&#8216;I see you little boy, you&#8217;re it!&#8217; Spotted me, danged if he
didn&#8217;t, by ginger! an&#8217; now the fun&#8217;s a&#8217;goin&#8217; to start
right along. Wow! this is what I like, an&#8217; pays up for a wheen o&#8217;
lazy days. How the blood does leap through a feller&#8217;s veins when he feels
he&#8217;s in action again. Oscar, old boy, here&#8217;s wishin&#8217; you all
the compliments o&#8217; the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_113'></a>113</span> season an&#8217; I hereby promise to send back
whatever you throw me. Go on and do your stuff, old hoss&#8211;I&#8217;m on to
your game okay!&#8221;</p>

<p>He found further cause for congratulation when he made certain that the plane
was now headed for the smiling surface of the little bay close by, showing that
the pilot intended to make his little splash, and take a look at the hidden
sloop with its illicit cargo of many cases that had been so mysteriously
snatched from the hands of those with whom he was in close association.</p>

<p>This was as Perk would have it if given any decision in the matter. Once the
amphibian started to taxi toward him and they would be placed on the same
footing, each with a machine-gun to back him up and former experience in
handling such a weapon equally balanced. Could anything be fairer than that,
Perk asked himself, preparing for business at the drop of the hat?</p>

<p>The plane had made contact with the water and was floating there like an
enormous aquatic fowl of some unknown species. Now the pilot was making a right
turn as though meaning to come down on Perk with the western breeze&#8211;his
motor was keeping up more or less of a furore, which told Perk that shrewd
though these up-to-date contraband runners might be, at least they had slipped a
cog by failing to keep up with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_114'></a>114</span> the inventions of the times, for undoubtedly this
pilot had no silencer aboard his craft to effectually muffle the exhaust of his
engine.</p>

<p>However, this was no time to bother about such minor things when the main
issue was whether he was destined to &#8220;get&#8221; the ex-war ace, or the
other put him out of action when the battle was on.</p>

<p>Perk shifted his gun so that its muzzle kept following the moving seaplane in
its advance. Let Oscar but make a start in his projected bombardment, and Perk
stood ready to answer with a similar fusilade that must rather astonish the
other, for as yet he could have no assurance that the concealed sloop was
manned&#8211;doubtless he would figure the seized craft had been hidden here and
temporarily abandoned until such convenient time as the captors could return
with recruits and run it to some port where the confiscated shipment might be
turned over to the proper authorities.</p>

<p>Just the same Oscar Gleeb might think it good policy to make sure of his
ground by spraying the boat&#8217;s deck with a round or two of searching
missiles before attempting to board it.</p>

<p>Whatever way the cat was going to jump, Perk knew the issue was bound to be
joined before many more seconds slipped past, and he held himself ready.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WHEN GREEK MET GREEK</span></h2>

<p>The seaplane had stopped short, although its engine still rattled away as
vehemently as ever. Perk understood the reason for this&#8211;Oscar may have
been a hot-headed youngster away back when the great war was on, but apparently
his later experiences had cooled his blood to some extent and he did not mean to
be too rash.</p>

<p>Doubtless he could by this time plainly make out the sloop which was so
skillfully concealed, especially from the air above, and there may have been a
sufficiently menacing air about it that called for caution. He was not such a
fool as to blindly walk into what might prove to be a clever trap, set by a
bunch of those despised Government workers to catch him napping.</p>

<p>Accordingly he considered it good policy to hold off and pepper the sloop
from stem to stern before taking any further steps at doing any boarding and
seizing it for its rightful owners.</p>

<p>Then again, in order to get the best work from his firearms and have his
hands free, he knew he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_116'></a>116</span> should fix matters so he could drop the controls
and pay strict attention to his other job.</p>

<p>Perk was lying low, holding himself in readiness for action. He believed he
would be amply protected by the logs he had piled up, but just the same he did
duck his head involuntarily at the first crack of the machine-gun the pilot of
the Curtiss boat was handling so lovingly, as though it might be an old and
valued &#8220;baby&#8221; in his estimation.</p>

<p>But just the same Perk could not allow any misunderstanding to keep the other
in ignorance of how matters stood&#8211;he had sent out his impudent challenge,
and Perk was quick to accept it.</p>

<p>So the din was further increased by a second barrage, chiming in with perhaps
its notes ranged along a little higher key, but on the whole playing skillfully
and merrily its own part in the mad chorus that reigned.</p>

<p>How the chatter of those two rapid-fire guns did carry on, with the splinters
flying every-which way as the missiles tore them loose from the logs and the
coaming of the sloop&#8217;s deck.</p>

<p>Perk was compelled to do most of his work while keeping his head down, lest
he be potted in that rain of bullets the other fighter was pouring in on him.
Consequently he could hardly be expected to do himself full justice. Perhaps
Oscar <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span> on his part
was working under a similar disadvantage, for he really had little in the way of
a barricade to intercept the shower to which he was being subjected.</p>

<p>Lucky for him he had shown the good sense to stop his advance with
considerable distance separating him from the hidden sloop&#8211;had they been
closer there was not one chance in ten that some damage would not have placed
his seaplane out of commission, even though the pilot himself escaped death.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a white flag shot up from the sloop&#8217;s breastworks. Oscar,
with the gallantry such as had ever distinguished the air fighters on both sides
in those days that tried men&#8217;s souls, ceased firing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give up?&#8221; he was bawling, as the rapid-fire guns both became
silent, while their hot barrels cooled off a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so you could notice it,&#8221; Perk shouted. &#8220;Jest wanted to
exchange a few words with you, if you&#8217;re Oscar Gleeb, an&#8217; it&#8217;s
true that you was a live-wire over there in France an&#8217; the
Argonne&#8211;say, is that all to the good, Mister Pilot?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other did not answer immediately. Plainly he must have been considerably
astonished at the queer turn the engagement had taken; and then again possibly
he did not exactly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
like the idea of being compelled to acknowledge his identity, fearing it might
be only a trap to ensnare him in the meshes of the law he had been defying so
flagrantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that matter to you?&#8221; he finally yelled testily, so
that Perk began to suspect he must have touched up the other with one of the
bullets that struck the seaplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! nothin&#8217; much,&#8221; sang out the complaisant Perk,
cheerfully, &#8220;on&#8217;y I wanted to let you know I was over there in the same
line and had the good luck to send down a few o&#8217; you Hun pilots in a
blazin&#8217; coffin. Wondered now if me&#8217;n an&#8217; you mightn&#8217;t a had a
private scrap o&#8217; our own in them bully times. Allers did hanker to have a
talk-fest with you, sense I heard &#8217;bout you bein&#8217; one o&#8217; them
bloomin&#8217; hot Junker pilots.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hoarse laugh greeted this amazing sally of Perk&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, what sort of a crazy gyp are you to want to talk things over
while we got this scrap on?&#8221; bellowed the helmeted man in the shot torn
cabin of the amphibian. &#8220;That&#8217;s our boat you&#8217;re standin&#8217;
on, and we need it in our business, see? Give you three minutes to clear out,
for I&#8217;m comin&#8217; aboard. Get that, Kamarad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing, Oscar old hoss, but when you do it&#8217;ll be feet first,
for I&#8217;m fixed to fill your carcass so full o&#8217; lead it wouldn&#8217;t
need any cannon ball <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_119'></a>119</span> to sink you if you died at sea. So mind your step,
Mister Pilot&#8211;jest been gettin&#8217; my hand in so far, but what&#8217;s
comin&#8217; next&#8217;ll be a whole lot different, bet your boots!&#8221;</p>

<p>The other did not show the white feather but immediately set to work once
more with his weapon. No sooner was its chatter &#8220;on the air&#8221; than
Perk started giving his own gun a chance to show its worth. This made it lively
again and once more those aggravating splinters began to scatter, worrying Perk
not a little, for strange to say he dreaded lest one of them find lodgment in
his anatomy and this troubled him much more than the possibility of being struck
by a speeding bullet.</p>

<p>It was quite warm while it lasted, but presently Perk realized that the
opposition had suddenly ceased. Being a polite man and always pleased to meet
his antagonist on even terms, Perk also stopped firing. If Oscar had decided to
advance once more and try conclusions at close quarters where it would be give
and take, he, Perk, could prove himself a most accommodating chap.</p>

<p>Sure enough the engine of the amphibian had started up with increased vigor
and Perk, cautiously lifting his head, saw that the plane was really in motion.
But it was also veering to one side, which action might mean either one of two
things&#8211;that the other had had quite enough of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span> this exchange of hot fire and was
pulling out, or else that in his crafty German way he was meaning some sort of
flank attack in hopes of carrying the fort.</p>

<p>Faster and faster was the taxiing airship rushing through the water and Perk
continued to hold his fire, realizing that the fight was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it, Oscar old hoss!&#8221; he burst out, as he grasped this
clinching finish of the strange engagement with the rival gunmen separating
after a hot exchange of compliments, each apparently able to move off under his
own steam, &#8220;Beat it for all you&#8217;re worth while the goin&#8217; is
good. There, he&#8217;s lifted his crate in one big pull an&#8217; I kinder
guess he ain&#8217;t hurt much either, else he couldn&#8217;t show so much
steam. Wall, here Perk&#8217;s been left in possession, after all that bluff he
put up. But it sure was a dandy jig while it lasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Perk began to laugh as though the true perspective had flashed before
his eyes for then, and later on, too, he was ready to declare that a more
ridiculous as well as unprofitable battle had never been waged between two rival
pilots of the upper air lanes.</p>

<p>Now the fleeing ship had mounted to a fair ceiling and was rushing off in a
roaring zoom but Perk noticed his late foe was heading due east as though bent
on picking out an entirely different direction from the one he had used <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span> when coming with an
impetuous rush to investigate the mysteries of the mangrove islands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! that strikes me as a bit queer,&#8221; Perk was telling himself
as he gazed after the ship, now growing smaller and smaller as it placed miles
between them. &#8220;Looks like Oscar might a remembered a mighty important
engagement he ought to keep. Oh well, I&#8217;ve had my little shindig, and
it&#8217;s just as well we both came through okay&#8211;them as &#8216;fights
an&#8217; runs away, may live to fight another day,&#8217; that old sayin&#8217;
has it which is sure a true thing. Hey! what&#8217;s this mean&#8211;seems like
I didn&#8217;t come through as soft-like as I figgered I had&#8211;blood on my
hand, yep, an&#8217; on my face ditto. Guess one o&#8217; them nasty
zippin&#8217; bullets must a creased my ear, and fetched the juice a little.
Shucks! nothin&#8217; to bother about I&#8217;d say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his old red bandanna and dabbed at his right ear with many a grunt as
well as chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems like it&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve weltered in my own gore
for a coon&#8217;s age,&#8221; Perk was saying as he looked at the stains on his
faithful if faded rag that had been his close companion on many a long flight
through fog and storm, wintry cold and summer heat. &#8220;But then I got a
notion Oscar must a&#8217;been nipped, too, mebbe a whole lot <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span> worse&#8217;n me. Honors are &#8217;bout
even, I guess, and if ever I do run across that lad again I&#8217;m
meanin&#8217; to shake hands with him, jest out o&#8217; consideration for the
fox an&#8217; geese game us air pilots used to play in the big ruction over
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>By chance Perk turned his gaze in another direction for he no longer found
any interest in keeping tabs on his late antagonist whose ship was now growing
dim in the distance, having entered among a bunch of fleecy clouds.</p>

<p>Hardly had Perk turned his head than he gave utterance to a low cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I see but another crate humping along this way, an&#8217;
outen the no&#8217;th in the bargain?&#8221; he observed, with ill concealed eagerness
in his tones. &#8220;Could it be Oscar, an&#8217; the other skunks got &#8217;em
a hull fleet o&#8217; airships to carry on their trade o&#8217; smugglin&#8217;
in licker, diamonds an&#8217; Chinks that want to get in this country
more&#8217;n they do the yeller man&#8217;s Paradise? Oh! rats, what&#8217;m I
thinkin&#8217; about&#8211;wake up, Gabe Perkiser, an&#8217; use your noodle
like it was given to you to handle. To be sure that second plane is our own bus,
with my pal handlin&#8217; the stick. An&#8217; I guess Oscar must a glimpsed
him headin&#8217; this way, which made him reckon this wasn&#8217;t the
healthiest place in the country for a feller o&#8217; his size, so he skipped
out <i>pronto</i>. Yep, that&#8217;s my pal for a cookey, I&#8217;d know his way
o&#8217; handlin&#8217; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_123'></a>123</span> a ship in a dozen an&#8217; as far as I could lamp
the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the whole he was extremely glad to see Jack returning, although also
pleased to know he had had his little frolic in a miniature battle that for the
brief period of its life had been able to give him a most delicious thrill.</p>

<p>He watched the oncoming ship grow in size and noted the significant fact that
its approach was so lacking in all the customary racket that deafens the human
ear.</p>

<p>Then presently a hand waved to him, Jack swung around and dropped with a
little splash upon the water&#8211;just where Oscar had so recently left
it&#8211;to taxi along and pull up close to the camouflaged sloop.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE COAST GUARD MEN</span></h2>

<p>Perk made a discovery just then that afforded him more or less satisfaction.
This was the fact that apparently Jack&#8217;s mission to Tampa had not been in
vain for he could see several heads in the cabin of the amphibian beside that of
his best chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! &#8217;pears like Jack fetched through okay, an&#8217; has ferried some
guys back with him to take this stuff off&#8217;n our hands,&#8221; Perk was
muttering, even as Jack started to clamber aboard the sloop, being closely
followed by a couple of determined looking young men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back again, brother,&#8221; Jack observed, as he clasped the extended
hand of his partner, then, gave a queer grimace upon taking note of the
splintered coaming of the sloop as well as the badly pockmarked barricade of
mahogany logs. &#8220;Say, what&#8217;s all this mean, I want to
know&#8211;looks like you might have been mixed up in some sort of rumpus while
I was away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk grinned and nodded his head cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had a heap o&#8217; fun, old boss, an&#8217; got loads o&#8217; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span> thrills out o&#8217; it.
Mebbe now you noticed some sort o&#8217; crate just vanishing among them clouds
off toward the east as you breezed along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I did,&#8221; came the immediate reply, &#8220;but the
visibility was getting poor, and I couldn&#8217;t be sure it wasn&#8217;t a
buzzard, or even an eagle ducking in and out. What&#8217;s it mean,
Perk&#8211;was he kicking up a mess around here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it, partner, an&#8217; his name was sure Oscar&#8211;Oscar
Gleeb, &#8217;cause he got mad as hops when I asked him, an&#8217; told me that
wasn&#8217;t any o&#8217; my business. But we sure did have a nice hot spell,
Oscar&#8217;n me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I reckon now you got your old right ear touched up again,
Perk, for I can see streaks of half-dried blood running down your
cheek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, he nicked me okay, an&#8217; if this keeps on much further
I&#8217;ll soon be taken for the Manassa Mauler, &#8217;cause it&#8217;ll gimme a
cauliflower ear. Who are these two lads, Jack&#8211;look like they might belong
to the Coast Guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what they are&#8211;meet Tom Cairns and Red McGrath, who have
been sent along with me to take charge of this contraband and hand it over to
Mr. Philip Ridgeway, temporarily in charge of the Treasury Department interests
along the West Coast here, with headquarters in Tampa&#8211;this is the fine pal
you heard me speaking about a few times, boys&#8211;Gabe Perkiser, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span> commonly known simply as
Perk, a veteran of the big scrap over in France where he flew one of those
sausage observation blimps, and was later on considered something of an ace in
our flying corps.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Perk gladly shook the hands extended to him, grinned in his genial
fashion, and from that moment on they were as brothers all.</p>

<p>&#8220;While we&#8217;re stretching our legs, after being cooped up in that
cramped cabin for some hours,&#8221; suggested Jack, whose curiosity had
naturally been aroused by the multitude of signs all around indicative of a warm
session, &#8220;suppose you sketch your little adventure for us, Perk. And I
want to say that Oscar was pretty much of a fool if he reckoned on snatching
this boat away from an old fighter like <i>you</i>, when you had a nice new
machine-gun to back up your claims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! he showed the right stuff for a scrapper,&#8221; expostulated
the honest Perk, anxious to give credit where credit was due. &#8220;We stopped
the barrage at one point to have a little chin, but unable to agree, we jest
started all over again. An&#8217; I kinder guess I must&#8217;ve notched the
critter some, for he hauled off an&#8217; skinned the cat by kickin&#8217; out.
I was jest tellin&#8217; myself it sure turned out to be a good thing he
didn&#8217;t have any Chinks aboard at the time, &#8217;cause they might&#8217;ve lost
the number o&#8217; their mess in the racket&#8211;I&#8217;m <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span> willin&#8217; to stop
the yeller boys from crashin&#8217; Unc&#8217; Sam&#8217;s gates, but I
don&#8217;t crave the job o&#8217; sendin&#8217; the poor dicks along to their
worshipped ancestors, not me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, get a move on you, Perk, and let&#8217;s have the story of your
fight&#8211;did he drop down, and have it out with you on the water; or was he
circling above your head all the while?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll take another squint at these bullet marks, old
hoss,&#8221; said Perk, reproachfully, &#8220;you&#8217;ll see they passed along
on the level. Yeah, he was a square shooter I want to say and some day I&#8217;m
hopin&#8217; me&#8217;n Oscar c&#8217;n shake hands, since the war&#8217;s long past
an&#8217; German is being taught again in our public schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he launched forth in a graphic, if terse, description of the remarkable
battle that had so recently taken place. The others listened with intense
interest, for if Perk did have a way of cutting his sentences short and never
going into lengthy descriptions, nevertheless he made his points tell, and kept
his audience of three breathing fast with the thrill they received.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s get a move on,&#8221; Jack was saying after Perk had
finished the exciting description of his adventure, &#8220;and go over all this
mess of cases, so these boys can give us a little document to say how we turned
over that number of boxes to their charge, together with the sloop. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span> McGrath here used to run
the engine of a tug in New York harbor and is well able to manage this rusty cub
here&#8211;we found it capable of doing a day&#8217;s work, you know Perk, on
the way here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack&#8217;s word was law, since he was in command. Accordingly they started
a systematic check of every case of bottled goods to be found aboard the
confiscated vessel, above and below decks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just an even two hundred and twenty-six,&#8221; announced Jack, after
they had gone over the entire lot twice with the same result. &#8220;I reckon a
few got away aboard that speedboat but they didn&#8217;t have much time to work
the racket before the hijacker mob swarmed aboard and kicked up that
riot&#8211;then along came Perk, with his armful of tear-bombs and broke up the
Boston tea party in great shape. I&#8217;ll make out a paper for both of you to
sign, after which you can kick-off when you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this was satisfactory to McGrath and his comrade and the paper having
been duly signed, they set about examining the engine so as to learn whether it
could have been injured in any way from the storm of missiles that came aboard
during the hostilities so lately ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bally old thing seems to be in fairly decent shape for
running,&#8221; was McGrath&#8217;s verdict after the checking had been
completed, &#8220;and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_129'></a>129</span> since we&#8217;ve got some distance to cover before
we make Tampa Bay, p&#8217;raps we&#8217;d better be shoving off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such big hurry as that, boys,&#8221; observed Jack.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit hungry myself and reckon you both must be in the same
boat. We&#8217;ve got plenty of grub, and to spare, also Perk here knows a few
wrinkles along the cooking line. Suppose we have some sort of spread to
celebrate Perk&#8217;s victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! pleases me okay, brother,&#8221; announced the expectant
<i>chef</i>. &#8220;I&#8217;ve run across a little rusty kerosene burnin&#8217;
stove here in what I&#8217;d call the cook&#8217;s galley, an&#8217; we might as
well have some hot coffee with the eats.&#8221;</p>

<p>As there were no dissenting votes the motion was carried unanimously;
whereupon Perk bustled around and soon had his coffee pot over an apology for a
flame which would, however, answer their purpose.</p>

<p>It was only a simple supper, but with good appetites to back them, every one
of the quartette declared it was great and would long be remembered.</p>

<p>Then the mess of saw palmetto leaves and other stuff utilized for camouflage
purposes was cast overboard after which McGrath &#8220;fiddled&#8221; with the
engine and soon had it running, limp and all, for its misses were plentiful,
although <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span> the
engineer allowed there did not seem to be anything fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we have fair luck,&#8221; he announced, confidently, &#8220;we
ought to fetch our Tampa dock, where all prizes are tied-up, before morning
comes along. On the other hand, if we break down we&#8217;ll either hang on to
the sloop, or if luck runs against us, sink her, after smashing every bottle
aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough, Red,&#8221; Jack told him as they shook hands for the
last time. &#8220;I hope we run across you boys again some day, and please keep
your lip buttoned about our being down here with an amphibian to knock some of
these smugglers of Chinks and rum galley-west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can depend on us to keep mum, Jack,&#8221; the red-headed
ex-harbor tug engineer assured him.</p>

<p>So the last line was cast off, Jack and Perk retired to their own ship, and
with many a wheeze and complaint the sloop started to pass out to the open gulf,
and commence the night journey to Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall,&#8221; Perk was remarking as the sloop passed beyond range of
their vision amidst the gathering shades of night, already drawing her sable
curtains close, &#8220;I hopes they get through without runnin&#8217; smack
against a bunch o&#8217; the racketeers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With fair luck they ought to manage to slip along,&#8221; Jack went on
to observe, confidently. &#8220;You heard me warn them to keep a watchful eye
out for smugglers and hijackers by land and sea and air? Anyway we&#8217;ve
finished our part of the job and this paper proves that our find was all I
cracked it up to be when I talked with Mr. Ridgeway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course, you knocked up against the gent then, eh Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, or I shouldn&#8217;t have been able to fetch those lads back
with me to take over the sloop and contraband cargo,&#8221; the other told him.
&#8220;But I was in a tail spin at first when I learned that Mr. Ridgeway had
gone down to St. Pete to interview some people who had reasons for not <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span> wanting to be seen going
into his Government offices in Tampa. But I got his address and jumped my boat,
slipped down Tampa Bay, and pulled in at the long municipal pier at St.
Petersburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I first hired a dependable man to keep watch over my ship while I was
off hunting my superior officer but I found him after a bit and he was sure glad
to see me, shook hands like a good sport, and asked me a bunch of questions
before starting to tell me what important fresh news he had picked up through
his agents working the spy game for all it was worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he tickled to learn how we managed to run off with that slick
little sloop that carried so neat a pack o&#8217; cases marked with foreign
stamps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seemed to be,&#8221; came the ready answer. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t a
man of many words, you know, Perk, but what he says he means. He told me they
were banking on the pair of us to bring the high-hat chaps at the head of this
smuggler league to the bar, with plenty of evidence that would convict them, no
matter how many big lawyers they employed to beat the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds all to the good with me, old hoss,&#8221; snapped the
pleased Perk. &#8220;&#8217;Taint often we get half the praise that&#8217;s
comin&#8217; to us&#8211;not that I care a whiff &#8217;bout that,
though&#8211;satisfied to do my duty by Unc&#8217; Sam, an&#8217; let them
high-ups <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span> have the
main credit. But I guess we&#8217;ll get some kick out o&#8217; the game just
the same an&#8217; that&#8217;s worth all it costs us. Tell me, did this Mr.
Ridgeway fork over any news worth knowin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did,&#8221; the other assured him. &#8220;I showed him those papers
I found hidden in the cabin of the sloop, with a fine list of names, such as
would cover customers who&#8217;d ordered the stuff they had aboard and he
reckoned that several of them might point to the heads of the combine swinging
the big smuggling deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a clue worth while, I&#8217;d say,&#8221; Perk asserted
warmly, his eyes flashing with renewed zeal as though he might be telling
himself they must be getting on a pretty warm scent which would soon lead them
to the party they sought above every one else&#8211;the capitalist whose word
was <i>law</i>, and whose money purchased all the supplies, from liquor and
vessels to aircraft and everything else needful for carrying on their business
of swindling the Government through the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>Just as he always did in forestalling any likely move when an important case
was placed in the hands of himself and Jack, Perk was already engaged in
mentally spreading the net destined to gather in the chief culprits&#8211;the
outlook promised a multitude of warm episodes calculated to stir the blood to
fever heat and afford <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_134'></a>134</span> him the wild excitement without which life lost
much of its charm&#8211;in his eyes at least.</p>

<p>The pulsating throb of the old engine aboard the sloop had long since ceased
to make itself heard, so that they could with reason believe McGrath and his pal
well on the way to their distant goal, with no sign of stormy weather to be seen
in the southwestern heavens.</p>

<p>&#8220;How &#8217;bout spendin&#8217; the night here, partner?&#8221; Perk
queried, as he sat contentedly smoking his favorite pipe after the manner of a
man who had good reason to congratulate himself on the close of a perfect
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking that over, Perk. We might be in a worse situation
than this, if locality was all that mattered. I don&#8217;t believe the &#8217;gators
would keep us awake with their splashing and roaring along towards early
morning, but then I&#8217;m a bit bothered thinking of the man who skipped out
after having his little machine-gun duel with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re jest crampin&#8217; my style when you say that,
partner,&#8221; complained Perk. &#8220;That Oscar happens to be a German, we
both know, an&#8217; from what I learned about the breed when over there,
they&#8217;re some obstinate, once they get workin&#8217; in a game&#8211;hate
to give it up wuss&#8217;n pizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;re of the same opinion as myself, buddy,&#8221; Jack
remarked, nodding his head. &#8220;You <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_135'></a>135</span> reckon there might be some chance for him to pick
up a bunch of his mates and swing back here to do a little bombing on his own
account. Well, we&#8217;re not hankering to try our own medicine, not if we know
it, and on that account I think we&#8217;d be wise to pull out of this and find
a new refuge&#8211;perhaps on some lake back from the coast where we might pick
up something interesting in our line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Je-ru-salem crickets! I kinder guess now you&#8217;ve got
somethin&#8217; danglin&#8217; back o&#8217; them words old hoss,&#8221; broke
out the newly interested Perk, showing considerable animation. He was used to
most of Jack&#8217;s habits and could in many instances tell that something lay
hidden back of his word&#8211;something of a character to promise great
happenings when followed to a finish.</p>

<p>That seemingly casual mention of a freshwater lake was not made without some
deep meaning&#8211;Jack must have been told something very important by the
Government official with whom he had gone into conference at Tampa and this was
his sly way of starting Perk&#8217;s wits to working overtime in the endeavor to
figure things out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see what&#8217;s in the wind, Perk,&#8221; said the head
pilot, with a chuckle. &#8220;I promise to let you into all I know or suspect
before a great while passes. Just now I&#8217;ll own up this scheme <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span> of slipping over to a
certain sheet of fresh water for a change of base has a meaning that connects
with our big game of Blind Man&#8217;s Buff.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed to square things with Perk, for he beamed as though pleased.
Whatever Jack decided was always all right in his eyes because he felt certain
that the bright mind of his comrade just could not make a blunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do we hop-off, then?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, when the moon shows up will be plenty of time,&#8221; came the
ready answer. &#8220;Our objective isn&#8217;t so very far distant and you know
we can make a hundred miles an hour if necessary. I&#8217;d like to pick up a
bit of my lost sleep while we wait, unless you object to standing
sentry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me, matey, I managed to snooze some during the time you were away.
Lucky I had everything fixed for company and wasn&#8217;t caught nappin&#8217;
when our friend Oscar tipped his hat an&#8217; made his bow. Now I was
wonderin&#8217; if he had that ole quick-firin&#8217; gun away back when he was
riddlin&#8217; things along in the Argonne&#8211;wouldn&#8217;t it be a queer
thing if true? He knew how to rattle that cantankerous bus to beat the band
an&#8217; he did nick me in that silly o&#8217; ear o&#8217; mine that keeps on
gettin&#8217; in the way every time I have a little spat with a sassy
guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk insisted on his chum making himself as comfortable as possible,
considering the cramped <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_137'></a>137</span> quarters they occupied in the cluttered cabin of
their ship, which continued to keep up a soothing movement with the successive
waves that worked in from the open gulf inclining a sleepy person to
slumber.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll jest sit here an&#8217; ruminate while I consume my
tobacco,&#8221; announced the accommodating Perk, making light of his job.
&#8220;Once in so often I&#8217;ll take a look skyward with the glasses,
so&#8217;s to know if there&#8217;s any chance o&#8217; Oscar comin&#8217; back
here to try it all over again. When the moon peeps up in the east yonder
I&#8217;ll put a hand on your arm, so&#8217;s to let you know it&#8217;s near
time. Go to it, partner&#8211;do your stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was feeling pretty tired, since he had enjoyed mighty little decent
sleep from one cause or another during the last few nights. It was not at all
surprising, therefore, that he should be in slumberland before five minutes
passed after he and Perk had exchanged the last word.</p>

<p>The self-posted sentinel did just as he had promised, every little while he
would quietly stand up and with the glasses take a keen observation, covering
the blue vault above from one horizon to another, then, finding all serene, he
would silently resume his seat, with only a sigh to indicate how he felt. Once
more he filled his everlasting pipe, began to puff delightedly, and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span> finally lay back in a
half reclining position to smoke it out.</p>

<p>He was a great hand at ruminating, as he called it&#8211;allowing his
thoughts to travel back to events that may have occurred months, and even years
before, but which had been of such a nature as to fix themselves in his memory
most tenaciously. This afforded him solid enjoyment, together with the charm of
his adored pipe and he asked for nothing better.</p>

<p>Thus an hour, two of them, and more passed, with nothing out-of-the-way
taking place to attract his attention. He figured that if the pilot of the
Curtiss-Robin crate intended to come back that night, he was subject to some
sort of delay.</p>

<p>There was frequent splashing in the lagoon near by&#8211;at times Perk could
tell it must be caused by jumping mullet, but on other occasions the sound being
many times exaggerated, he reckoned it had been made by an alligator plunging
off a log into the water, either alarmed by some sound further off, or else
possessed of a desire to enter a secret underwater den he laid claim to. This
would probably have a second entrance, or exit, up on some hummock that Perk had
failed to discover when poking around on the preceding day hunting green stuff
with which to conceal the deck of the sloop.</p>

<p>Suddenly Perk noticed a slim streak of pale <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_139'></a>139</span> light fall athwart the propeller blade just before
him and looking hastily up discovered the smiling face of the moon&#8211;a bit
battered it is true, for the silvery queen of night was just then on the
wane.</p>

<p>It was high time they were moving and making for the goal Jack had mentioned
as an inland lake, though at no time did he give the name by which it was known
to the settlers and tourists who flocked to Florida during the late Fall and
early Winter. So he touched Jack on the shoulder, just he he had promised he
would do, nor did he have to give the slightest shake for the other stirred and
raised his head, showing he was wide awake.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LOCKHEED-VEGA FLYING SHIP</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Moon coming up, partner!&#8221; was all Perk said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s time we were moving,&#8221; Jack told him as he
started to stretch his cramped arms and yawn. &#8220;Feel a heap better now
after that little nap and ready for what&#8217;s coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not have much to do, since everything was in perfect condition for
hopping-off&#8211;trust Jack for that, with his slogan of &#8220;be
prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All set, Perk?&#8221; asked the pilot, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot!&#8221; was the terse answer.</p>

<p>The bright moon would have to take the place of the customary equipment of a
landing field in the way of guidelights, markers, and search-lights, but there
was no necessity for so much light with the channel before him along which he
could taxi unerringly, until, arriving at the point where the great gulf
stretched out toward the western horizon, the speed must be advanced for the
take-off.</p>

<p>Now they were free from the mangroves and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_141'></a>141</span> Jack accelerated the pace of his ship
accordingly&#8211;two twin foam-crested waves rolled out from the pontoons as
they sped along until, testing things, Jack found that his charge was impatient
to leave the water and leap upward into space.</p>

<p>Perk looked backward toward the scene of his amazing afternoon
battle&#8211;how many times in the future would the picture rise in his memory
to haunt him and bring that quizzical grin to his face.</p>

<p>With the newly risen moon gilding the small waves of the gulf below them, the
picture looked most peaceful. Perk, although not much inclined to romance, could
not but admire the spectacle after his own rude fashion while Jack fairly drank
it in as he continued to pay attention to his manifold duties.</p>

<p>Their course was almost due north, Jack keeping out a score or more of miles
from the coast, having reasons of his own for so doing&#8211;perhaps he found
the wind more favorable out there and this is always an important factor in the
calculations of a pilot of experience. Just as in the earlier days of ocean
steamers when they were also equipped with masts and sails, the latter were
always hoisted when the wind favored, since this helped them make progress and
saved coal at the same time.</p>

<p>They had been booming along for something <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_142'></a>142</span> like half an hour when watchful Perk, the observer,
made a discovery worth while he believed. He communicated with his companion,
the useful earphones chancing to be in place&#8211;trust Perk for that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somethin&#8217; doin&#8217; out there to the west, partner&#8211;look
up to a higher ceilin&#8217; an&#8217; you&#8217;ll see it. Headin&#8217; to
cross over our trail in the bargain, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A crate, all right,&#8221; commented Jack, whose quick eyesight had
immediately picked up the moving object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it might a come all the way across the
gulf&#8211;d&#8217;ye think from some Mexican port, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like as not,&#8221; assented the other. &#8220;These crooks make a
start from any one of a score of jumping-off places, but always with a specified
landing field ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you figger,&#8221; continued Perk, &#8220;he might be one
o&#8217; the gang, fetchin&#8217; Chinks across or mebbe precious stones, bought
in Paris, and shipped to Mexico on the way to New York, eh, partner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chances are three to one that&#8217;s what it means,&#8221; Jack told
him.</p>

<p>Perk continued to wield his important binoculars and presently, when the
lofty plane was passing over, he stated his opinion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>&#8220;&#8217;Taint
<i>him</i>, anyway, that&#8217;s dead sure, Jack, I guess I ought to know a
Lockheed-Vega crate, no matter how far away, or by what tricky moonlight either,
&#8217;cause you see I used to run one o&#8217; that breed for nearly a year when I
took a whirl at the air-mail business up north out o&#8217; Chicago till I had a
bad crash an&#8217; quit cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it then, partner,&#8221; said the pilot, still observing
the speck swinging past out of the tail of his eye. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t any
idea it could be the same chap you had your little picnic with some hours back,
for you told me he&#8217;d blown off toward the east.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest what he did,&#8221; replied the observer. &#8220;Ginger pop! but
what wouldn&#8217;t I give right now to know jest whar that galoot was
meanin&#8217; to drop down, once he gets over the land. How &#8217;bout that,
old hoss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might help out considerable,&#8221; admitted Jack although not as
much interested as Perk considered he might be. &#8220;We&#8217;ll sift things
out in good time, and for all we know, run across a few surprises in the
bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk studied that last part for a minute, feeling almost certain Jack had
some deep meaning back of his words, but it proved too much for his capacity in
the line of figuring out mysteries, and so he dropped it &#8220;like a hot
potato,&#8221; as he told himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>The mysterious
air voyager had by now disappeared entirely, although they might still have
caught the throbbing of his madly working motor had it not been for their own
engine kicking up so much racket, Jack not being inclined to make use of the
capable silencer just then.</p>

<p>Perk had made up his mind that the unknown aviator, even if other than Oscar
Gleeb, was undoubtedly working the same profitable line of business as the pilot
of the Curtiss-Robin ship. So, too, Perk considered it worth while to try and
figure out the exact course of the high flyer as he was probably making directly
for his intended goal and this knowledge was likely to prove useful to them
later on.</p>

<p>This he was able to accomplish. Working mental problems come easily to one
who has played the part of a navigator aboard a modern galleon of the
clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted Perk after figuring out his problem twice and both
times reaching the same conclusion, &#8220;the guy&#8217;s really striking in to
mighty near the same point Jack&#8217;s meanin&#8217; to make and mebee now our
lines might cross if we both kept on goin&#8217; long enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>He studied this matter for some time, wondering if Jack also realized the
fact and had kept silent about it for good and sufficient reasons.</p>

<p>It afforded the ambitious Perk considerable <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_145'></a>145</span> satisfaction to hug the idea to his heart that
possibly the chance might be given Jack and himself to locate some of these land
stations where all this flagrant smuggling business was going on&#8211;the
prospect of their&#8217;s being the force to deal the outlaw organization a
killing blow brought in its train the thrill he loved so well.</p>

<p>Then came the moment when Jack banked and changed his course radically,
heading directly into the east where lay the peninsula of Ponce de Leon, seeker
after the Spring of Eternal Youth, and finding instead, a land of flowers.</p>

<p>Perk knew what this evidently meant&#8211;that Jack had flown far enough up
the west coast and was now bent on making for that inland sheet of fresh water
he had mentioned to his comrade as a likely place for them to drop down and pass
the balance of the night.</p>

<p>The uncertainty was keeping Perk keyed up to a high tension&#8211;something
told him in no uncertain tones that Jack had a vastly more important reason for
attaining that lake than the mere desire to avoid attracting
attention&#8211;just what it might mean he could not guess, for when he
attempted to solve the enigma he found himself floundering in a shoreless sea of
doubt and uncertainty that was baffling, to say the least.</p>

<p>Perk was mumbling to himself as if he might be on the verge of reaching some
sort of decision. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
He bent forward several times as if about to make an important remark and on
each occasion drew back, as though he could hardly decide how to approach the
matter he had in his mind. Then he would chuckle, as if it might have its
humorous side as well as a serious one.</p>

<p>Already had they reached a point where he could easily see the shore several
thousand feet below and now Jack was sliding down as if bent on striking a
ceiling that would be only a few hundred feet above the palmetto fringe Perk
could distinguish running along the coast.</p>

<p>It seemed a fitting time for him to give Jack the start he contemplated and
so, summoning his courage, Perk began to talk in as unconcerned a tone as
possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Partner, would you mind tellin&#8217; me what about this here Oswald
Kearns?&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>OKEECHOBEE THE MYSTERIOUS</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Say that again, Perk!&#8221; demanded the startled pilot, as though
that apparently innocent question had given him a severe jolt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oswald Kearns&#8211;kinder queer name, I kinder guess now, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m wonderin&#8217; if I ever heard it before&#8211;that&#8217;s all,
Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot was busy with his work in handling the ship and therefore debarred
from turning his head to look at his companion but at least he could put the
astonishment he felt into words.</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8211;you think that&#8217;s a queer name, do you? Well, I&#8217;m
asking you again, where did you ever run across it&#8211;who ever spoke it in
your hearing, Perk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;er, guess it was on&#8217;y <i>you</i>, partner,&#8221; came the
hesitating reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say?&#8221; gasped Jack, tremendously excited,
&#8220;please tell me when that happened because I don&#8217;t remember doing
such a thing, though I meant to carry out our partnership arrangement this very
night when we had settled down and could have a nice quiet confab&#8211;go on,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span> though, and say
when I lifted the lid, and let you into this part of our big game,
Perk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! you talked in your sleep some, old hoss&#8211;first time ever I
knew you to do sech a thing&#8211;said that name exactly three times, like it
meant a heap in the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean <i>tonight</i> while I was picking up a few winks of
sleep&#8211;is that a fact, Perk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing, boss&#8211;course I knew somethin&#8217; must be
pesterin&#8217; you like all get-out, so I made up my mind to ask you who that
Oswald might be an&#8217; what we&#8217;d got to do with such a
critter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jack laughed as the humorous side of his recent thrill had begun to grip
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, seems like I&#8217;ll soon have to put a padlock on my
lips after this when I hit the hay. It&#8217;s a serious offence for a fellow in
<i>our</i> profession to give away his secrets like that! Never knew myself to
be guilty of babbling that way before. Lucky you were the only one to hear me
give the game away so recklessly. The joke is on me, partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But say, Jack, whoever is this Kearns guy anyhow&#8211;I sure never
heard his name before tonight an&#8217; I kinder got the idee in my head he must
be some big-wig you ran up against when in Washington&#8211;somebody who had the
orderin&#8217; around o&#8217; poor dicks like me&#8217;nd you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a far guess, brother,&#8221; Jack told him, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span> &#8220;for the fact of
the matter is, this Oswald Kearns happens to be a certain party just now under
suspicion as being the king-pin of these smugglers who&#8217;re giving Uncle Sam
a run for his money down along this gulf coast!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk took it with a little break, as though the information fairly staggered
him, but he was quickly back again at his fly-casting&#8211;seeking information
at the fount in which he had so much faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sent me into a reg&#8217;lar tail spin that time, Jack, but after
tellin&#8217; me so much, it&#8217;d be right cruel to keep me a&#8217;guessin&#8217;
any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to keep you in the dark after this, Perk,&#8221; he
was told in jerky, broken sentences, as though Jack found it difficult to talk
and pay the proper attention to what he was doing, for the amphibian had again
commenced a steep dive, seeking a much lower altitude. &#8220;There are too many
things connected with the story to try and spin it now&#8211;just hold your
horses till we settle down on that lake, and you&#8217;ll get it&#8211;all I
know, or suspect, anyhow. Just now I can only tell you that this Kearns is a
most remarkable personage, a baffling mystery to the Department who&#8217;s
outsmarted the whole Service and played his game of hide-and-seek before their
very eyes&#8211;nobody so far has been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_150'></a>150</span> able to pick up a shred of positive evidence that
would convict him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh, amighty, we&#8217;re flyin&#8217; high, buddy!&#8221; was what
Perk exclaimed and immediately his wits went into a huddle. He must get busy and
figure things out, just as football teams do when a change in signals becomes
essential.</p>

<p>They had been passing over the land for some little time and still Jack kept
heading almost directly into the northeast. He knew just where he expected to
make his goal, due to a close application to his charts and maps of the Florida
region.</p>

<p>Debarred from fishing for information while the flight was on, Perk was
forced to seek consolation in making good use of his binoculars, sweeping the
heavens for signs of other suspicious planes or endeavoring to make out the
character of the terrain over which they were speeding.</p>

<p>Occasionally he managed to discover some tiny light and this gave him an
opportunity to speculate as to its meaning&#8211;if isolated he concluded it
must either be a campfire made by alligator hunters, or a street light in some
small hamlet, such as he imagined might be found in this almost wild section of
lower Florida where the Everglades with their eternal water kept settlers from
picking out locations for starting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_151'></a>151</span> truck patches or citrus groves&#8211;all of which
would probably be vastly changed when the great reclamation plans for draining
had been fully carried out.</p>

<p>He often felt certain he glimpsed water below and had enough knowledge of the
country to understand what that would mean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder jest how long he means to keep this up,&#8221; Perk was saying
to himself when the better part of an hour had passed since they left the open
gulf behind, &#8220;huh! by this time we must a&#8217;gone more&#8217;n sixty miles
an&#8217; say, in places the hull State ain&#8217;t more&#8217;n a hundred
across from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mex. Gulf. Whoopee! could it mean
he&#8217;s aimin&#8217; to strike that terrible, big
lake&#8211;Okeechobee&#8211;that overflowed its banks not long ago when they had
that nasty hurricane and drowned a wheen o&#8217; poor folks around Moore Haven?
Gee whiz! it&#8217;s got me a&#8217;guessin&#8217; but then Jack knows what he&#8217;s
tryin&#8217; to do, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to leave it all up to him to
settle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow this suggestion appealed to Perk as being quite in line with the
magnitude of their tremendous task&#8211;it was only appropriate to have the
scene of their coming operations the biggest freshwater lake by long odds in the
entire State, barring none&#8211;it would have been what Perk might term as
&#8220;small pertatoes, an&#8217; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_152'></a>152</span> few in a hill,&#8221; to have such a wizard of an
operator as Oswald Kearns pick out an ordinary body of water, say of a mile in
diameter, as his secret headquarters where he could continue to keep his
whereabouts unknown to the Government revenue men.</p>

<p>Lake Okeechobee&#8211;well, that certainly offered some scope for any display
of their own cleverness in finding the proofs they so yearned to possess in
rounding up the &#8220;cantankerous varmint,&#8221; as Perk was already calling
Kearns in his Yankee vernacular.</p>

<p>It could not be much longer delayed, Perk assured his eager self&#8211;less
than another hour of this sort of work would take them entirely across the
peninsula, and cause the plane to fetch up somewhere along the Atlantic coast
between Miami and Palm Beach. Much as Perk would like to set eyes upon those two
opulent Southern winter resorts in the midst of their splendor, he felt that
such a thing would hardly be proper under the conditions by which their visit
would have to be governed&#8211;small chance for anything bordering on secrecy
to be carried out in such a region of sport seeking and excitement day after
day.</p>

<p>Ah! it must be coming closer now, he decided on noting how, far below the
plane, he could make out what looked like a vast sea with little <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span> wavelets glimmering in
the light of the moon&#8211;assuredly that must indeed be the lonely lake, long
known as the home of mystery, Okeechobee, the mightiest stretch of fresh water
in the whole country of the South.</p>

<p>Jack was passing up along the western shore line as though his plan of
campaign called for a descent in some obscure quarter where they could find a
hideout in which to park their aircraft while they pursued their urgent call
ashore.</p>

<p>Not the faintest gleam of light anywhere proved that settlers were indeed few
and far between and this fact would also explain just why Oswald Kearns, wishing
for secrecy and isolation, had selected this region as best suited to his
purpose.</p>

<p>Now Jack was dropping steadily, his silencer in full play&#8211;it was time
for Perk to get busy and through the use of his marine night glasses keep his
pilot posted regarding what lay below them.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MASTER CROOK</span></h2>

<p>One thing Perk noticed with more or less satisfaction as they drew closer to
the surface of the water was the fact that quite a stiff breeze seemed to be
blowing out of the north. The waves were running up along the shore with
considerable vigor and noise while the dead leaves hanging from the palmetto
trees fringing the bank above the meagre beach kept up a loud rustling, such as
would effectually drown any ordinary splash made by the contact of their
pontoons with the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>Conditions could hardly have been more favorable for an undetected
landing&#8211;the time was late, so that it hardly seemed as though any one
would be abroad, the moon kept dodging behind successive clumps of dark clouds
that had swept up from the southwest and everything seemed to be arranged just
as Jack would have wished.</p>

<p>Perk had received instructions from his mate to keep on the watch for certain
landmarks that would serve to tell them they were not far <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span> distant from their intended location.
When in due time he made out the wooded point that jutted out so commandingly
from the mainland and had communicated that fact to the pilot, Jack turned the
nose of his craft sharply downward, proving that the decisive moment was at
hand.</p>

<p>Noted for his ability to carry through a delicate landing, Jack certainly
never did a prettier drop into a body of water, fresh or salt, with less
disturbance than on this momentous occasion, and they were soon riding like a
wild duck, just within sight of the shore.</p>

<p>There were no signs of anything stirring along the waterfront, Perk observed,
and yet if his suspicions were correct, there must have been considerable
activity around that same spot, with a ship coming in laden with stupefied
Chinamen, terrified by making such a trip from Cuba or some Mexican port in a
&#8220;flying devil&#8221; that could soar up among the very clouds and span the
widest of angry seas&#8211;perhaps on the other hand the incoming aircraft would
bring a cargo of precious cases, each almost worth its weight in silver or maybe
the skipper would carry a small packet in his pocket that might contain a
duke&#8217;s ransom in diamonds that would never pay custom duties to the
Government.</p>

<p>No wonder then Perk was thrilled to the core <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_156'></a>156</span> with the sense of mystery that brooded over this
most peculiar locality&#8211;to him it already assumed a condition bordering on
some of those miraculous things he could remember once reading in his
boyhood&#8217;s favorite book &#8220;The Arabian Night&#8217;s
Entertainment,&#8221; the glamour of which had never entirely left him.</p>

<p>But already Jack was casting about, as though eager to find some place of
concealment where they could stow the ship away and so prevent prying eyes from
making a disastrous discovery&#8211;disastrous at least to those plans upon
which Jack was depending for the successful outcome of his dangerous
mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to taxi up the shore a mile or so,&#8221; he was
telling Perk in the softest manner possible, although the noise made by the
rolling waves and the clashing dead palmetto leaves dangling from the lofty
crowns of the numerous trees would have deadened voices raised even to their
natural pitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; was all Perk allowed himself to say, but it testified to
his understanding of the policy involved in Jack&#8217;s general scheme of
things.</p>

<p>This was done as quietly as the conditions allowed, and how fortunate it was
they had held off from crossing over from the gulf until the middle of the
night&#8211;but then it might be <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_157'></a>157</span> expected that Jack would consider all such things
in laying out his movements.</p>

<p>In the end they managed to get the amphibian between two jutting banks where
the vegetation was so dense that there was no chance of a trail or road passing
that way. In the early morning Jack planned to once again conceal his ship, even
as the captured sloop had been camouflaged by Perk&#8217;s clever use of green
stuff.</p>

<p>&#8220;That part of the job&#8217;s done and without any slip-up,&#8221; Jack
was saying, vastly relieved, &#8220;and now we can take things easy for a spell,
during which time I&#8217;ll try and post you as far as I can about this queer
fish, Oswald Kearns, and what they&#8217;ve begun to suspect he&#8217;s been
doing all this while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place he&#8217;s about as wealthy as any one would want
to be, so the reason for his playing this game doesn&#8217;t lie back of a
desire to accumulate money. Some say he must have run afoul of the customs
service in the days when he hadn&#8217;t fallen heir to his fortune and all this
is just spite work to get even&#8211;a crazy idea, but there may be a germ of
truth in it after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a wonderful place not far out of Miami&#8211;they all say
it&#8217;s a regular palace, where he entertains lavishly and yet not at any
time have they known of a raid staged on his castle, as some call the rambling
stone building that shelters a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_158'></a>158</span> curio collection equal to any in the art museums of
New York City.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every little while Oswald Kearns disappears and no one seems to know
his whereabouts&#8211;some guess he&#8217;s fond of tarpon fishing and goes out
with a pal to indulge in the sport, his destination being kept secret so that
the common herd can&#8217;t swarm about the fishing grounds and annoy him; then
another lot say he is not the bachelor he makes out, but has a little cozy home
somewhere else with a wife who detests society and that&#8217;s where he goes
when away from the Miami paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of these guesses are wide of the truth&#8211;what they told me up
at the Treasury Department set me thinking and I found some papers aboard that
sloop we captured that opened up a startling line of action that might be
unbelievable if it were any other man than the eccentric Oswald
Kearns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Perk, after I&#8217;d committed the contents of those
papers to memory I sent them by registered mail to Headquarters because, you
see, something might happen to us before we get to the end of this journey and I
reckoned the Department would like to be able to take advantage of our
discoveries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did jest right there, partner,&#8221; Perk told him&#8211;he was
sitting there drinking it all in with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_159'></a>159</span> the utmost eagerness. &#8220;It sure would be a
pity if we kicked off an&#8217; Uncle Sam couldn&#8217;t profit by what work
we&#8217;d done. But what you&#8217;ve already told me &#8217;bout this here
queer guy gets my goat, like as not there never was a feller as full o&#8217;
kinks as he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty certain of that, partner,&#8221; Jack assured him,
&#8220;there&#8217;s no doubt about his having been gassed in the war and that
might account for his actions&#8211;he&#8217;s dippy along certain lines and he
finds this way of defying the Government gives him the one big thrill he wants.
It&#8217;s almost incredible, I own up, but I believe we&#8217;re going to prove
it before we quit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some men you know find this excitement in driving a speeding car along
the beach up at Daytona at a hundred miles and more an hour, others go out and
hunt tigers in India, lions and elephants in wildest Africa, but with this
wealthy sportsman the craze takes the form of snapping his fingers in contempt
at Uncle Sam&#8217;s Coast Guard and all the revenue men in Florida.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a bit skeptical at first, it all seemed so silly, such a whimsey
for a rich man to fancy&#8211;taking such big risks just for the thrill he
got&#8211;but the more I picked up about the man the less inclined I became to
doubt, and by now I&#8217;m convinced it is the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>&#8220;But what
makes him keep all this smuggling business clear of this wonderful show place
near Miami?&#8221; asked Perk, apparently still groping as though in a daze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wants to be living his double life,&#8221; explained Jack,
&#8220;with one line never crossing the other&#8211;you might call it a Jekyll
and Hyde sort of an existence. But the truth will come out in broad daylight if
ever we <i>do</i> round him up and catch him with the goods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8211;&#8217;bout how long will we be in makin&#8217; some sort
o&#8217; start, boss?&#8221; asked Perk anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may have to stick around here for some days while we do a little
spy work and lay our net,&#8221; Jack told him. &#8220;A great deal depends on,
how the land lies and what success we strike in making our approach&#8211;you
know how it is with all golfers&#8211;approach means a whole lot to them. But if
we have the good fortune to nab our man after making certain we have plenty of
convincing evidence to be used against him, why there&#8217;s our boat ready to
spirit him away before his gang can forcibly take him off our hands.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SCENT GROWS WARMER</span></h2>

<p>It all seemed so simple, as Jack put it, that Perk felt everything was bound
to come their way eventually if not just then. All the same his sound common
sense told him there was apt to be some pretty lively times in store for them
before the end they sought had been obtained.</p>

<p>He had the feeling of one who had been fed up on thrilling details and
figured on having a great volume of tragic possibilities to mull over in his
customary fashion&#8211;for all the world, as Jack often told him, like a cow
chewing her cud.</p>

<p>Realizing that Jack had now posted him thoroughly, Perk managed to curb his
curiosity besides, the chances were his pal would be likely to frown on anything
approaching garrulity.</p>

<p>Several hours passed and most of this time they spent taking short naps in
order to keep in condition for anything that might crop up. Then came the dawn,
to find Perk pawing over his haversack in which he had food stowed away, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span> with which he calculated
to meet any &#8220;hold-over&#8221; that might come along.</p>

<p>That dawn was a wonderful one, especially for those unaccustomed to what
Florida could offer in the way of sunrises. Even while the pair partook of their
limited breakfast, they kept an eye on the amazingly delicate shades of color
that marked the approach of the sun above the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>But they had work ahead and could not waste time by lingering over the early
morning meal. In order to lessen the chances of discovery it would be necessary
for them to conceal the ship from spying eyes and with his former effectual
result in camouflage as a sample of how it could best be accomplished, Perk took
it upon himself to repeat the operation.</p>

<p>They had aboard the amphibian a cleverly arranged collapsible canvas boat
that could be launched in short order and was to be propelled by means of a
short but serviceable paddle. While up in Canada with the Mounties, Perk had
become quite proficient in the use of a paddle and also in balancing by sheer
instinct while in a tipsy little canoe.</p>

<p>Accordingly he convinced his chum that since both of them could hardly expect
to occupy the small shallop and carry any quantity of greens, it was up to him,
Perk, to put the job through in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_163'></a>163</span> good shape. Jack could be checking up his motor and
taking a survey of the boat so as to make certain it was in serviceable
condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cause you know, partner,&#8221; Perk went on solemnly, &#8220;when we
<i>do</i> want to skip out it&#8217;s bound to be in a hoppin&#8217; hurry
an&#8217; there&#8217;d be no time to look her over then, by jiminy. Jest lie
around an&#8217; take things easy-like&#8211;your work is a&#8217;goin to be mostly
with the brain, while I&#8217;m the lad to use the muscle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack felt that since the canoe was so diminutive, Perk&#8217;s logic was
unanswerable, so he agreed to the division of labor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only, if it turns out that the job&#8217;s a bigger one than you
reckon on, buddy, you&#8217;ll let me take a whirl at it,&#8221; he suggested,
to which the other simply grinned and nodded his head.</p>

<p>The work went on steadily and Perk eventually had every part of the amphibian
covered with deceptive green stuff, well calculated to hoodwink any air pilot
passing directly over the spot.</p>

<p>This accomplished, he was ready to call it a day and drop down close to Jack
for a resting spell. When they talked it was in low tones, almost bordering on
whispers, for Jack took no chances of some enemy being within gunshot range of
their hideout, whose ears would be likely to catch the sound of ordinary
voices.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>Jack, observing
what his chum had accomplished, felt compelled to give the artist his meed of
commendation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure made a fine job of smothering things with all this stuff,
Perk,&#8221; he told him, which was music in the other&#8217;s ears, since he
would rather have Jack praise him than any one he knew. &#8220;No easy thing to
hide these stretched-out wings and the fuselage, too, as well as the shiny parts
of the crate&#8211;motor, propeller, and such, but <i>you</i> fixed it to beat
the band.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can that sort o&#8217; talk, partner&#8211;it was a soft job an&#8217;
anybody with sense could a&#8217;done it as good as yours truly. Goin&#8217; to be a
sure enough long day, &#8217;cordin&#8217; to my way o&#8217; lookin&#8217; at
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! nothing like having a little patience,&#8221; commented Jack
calmly, for he seldom showed signs of being in a hurry. &#8220;Men in our line
of business must learn to just hang on and wait for the proper minute to strike
the hook home in the fish&#8217;s jaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, an&#8217; then hang on some more, after they git the barb well
hooked, with the game fish kickin&#8217; up an awful row,&#8221; chuckled Perk.
&#8220;Huh! don&#8217;t I know how impatience is my besettin&#8217; sin and
ain&#8217;t I always a&#8217;tryin&#8217; to curb it? That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m crazy
to work in double harness with you, brother, &#8217;cause you hold me in when I feel
like spreadin&#8217; myself brashly. Guess I know <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span> when I&#8217;m well off. Time to take
another spin in dreamland, seems like,&#8221; with which remark Perk assumed as
easy a position as the crowded cabin of the ship admitted, closed his eyes, and
so far as Jack could tell from his regular breathing was asleep.</p>

<p>It was indeed a long morning for them both.</p>

<p>Came noon and they again proceeded to enjoy a snack, for appetites have a
habit of growing rampant despite any lack of expenditure in the way of muscular
activity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was jest thinkin,&#8221; Perk remarked as they chewed their dry
food, more as a duty than because they enjoyed it, &#8220;that we might be put
on short rations if we&#8217;re held up on this here job any great length
o&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack refused to be disturbed by such a possibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I reckon there isn&#8217;t much chance of <i>that</i>
happening,&#8221; he said in his usual optimistic manner. &#8220;If things get
pretty bad we can make a foray on the pantry of the shack where our friend puts
up when over here. Knowing that he&#8217;s fond of his grub, with oceans of the
long green to lay in the best of supplies with, I rather think he keeps a
well-stocked larder at all times. I don&#8217;t figure on either of us being
starved out while there&#8217;s a flock of eatables close by,&#8221; and from
the way in which Perk licked his lips on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_166'></a>166</span> hearing this said, it was plainly evident he fully
agreed with his pal.</p>

<p>After that wonderful sunrise, which even Perk had called glorious, the sky
clouded up around noon and there were even signs to warn them that rain might
come along by nightfall. The visibility, too, became somewhat poor which
possibly was one reason that influenced Jack to make a certain decision which
Perk heard later on with unbounded pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting on my nerves a bit, too, I must confess,
Perk,&#8221; was the way he started to state his case, &#8220;and since there
would be small chance of discovery, thanks to this muggy atmosphere,
what&#8217;s to hinder our taking a little stroll, keeping a wary eye out for
stragglers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get you, partner,&#8221; was the eager way Perk snapped him up on
the proposition which exactly tallied with what he himself had been wishing.
&#8220;I calculate now it means we c&#8217;n move around an&#8217; get tabs on this
here hideout o&#8217; the gent we&#8217;re so much in love with, eh,
what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t do any harm to learn the lay of the land,&#8221; Jack
told him, &#8220;especially since we mean to do most of our snooping under cover
of night. So let&#8217;s step out and take our little saunter. We know right
well in a general way that the shack must lie down the shore, by that point
jutting out a mile away. Let&#8217;s hope we&#8217;ll be able to run <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span> across some kind of
trail by following which we&#8217;ll fetch up as close as we want to go for the
first time. Both of us must make a mental map of everything we see so as to feel
sure of our ground when darkness comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket, partner, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk lost no time in picking up the small hand machine-gun, that could be
used much after the fashion of a long barreled German Luger quick-firing pistol
and when Jack looked dubiously at it his chum hastened to explain his reason for
lugging such a weapon along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! the weight don&#8217;t count with such a husky as me, old hoss
an&#8217; how do we know what&#8217;s goin&#8217; to happen before we gets back
here? These guys, I take it, are quick on the trigger and if we got to fight
we&#8217;d have a better chance to pull out alive if we carried this little
pill-box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well! have it your own way, brother,&#8221; Jack told him,
evidently impressed with Perk&#8217;s logic; and so they started forth.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>DENIZENS OF THE FLORIDA SWAMPS</span></h2>

<p>After all it was perhaps a wise determination on the part of Jack to thus
take time by the forelock and endeavor to learn the lay of the land while a
fitting opportunity lasted. To start out when darkness lay over everything, with
no knowledge whatever concerning the prospect before them, would have doubled
the chances for some grievous calamity overtaking them even before they were
ready to strike their first blow.</p>

<p>Jack had a pretty strong suspicion they were in the neighborhood of some
stretch of swampland&#8211;he was backed in this supposition by several
things&#8211;the general low lay of the ground bordering the great lake and also
the fact that snowy white egrets, as well as cranes, flew to and fro during the
early morning, as though they must have a roost not far away and he had been
told that as a rule these gathering places were to be found in the gloomy depths
of a swamp.</p>

<p>If they should chance to lose their way in those dark and dismal swamps and
find themselves mired in the mud holes, they would be in <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span> a sorry fix, and they might even be
forced to shout for assistance in order to save their lives, thus revealing
themselves to their enemy, for the tenacious muck had a tendency to act in the
same treacherous fashion as quicksand, clutching the victim and dragging him
down, inch after inch into its unfathomable depths.</p>

<p>Hardly were they started than one pleasing discovery was made. Just as Jack
had hoped might be the case, a dim trail was struck not far back from the border
of the silent lake, that gave promise of leading them in the course they planned
to go.</p>

<p>Jack made certain that there were no signs of this trail having been used by
human beings&#8211;at least in recent times; possibly it may have originally
been an Indian trail in those days when Osceola and his gallant followers dared
defy the powers at Washington and declare open war upon the few white squatters
at that time in the southern portions of the Florida peninsula. Or, what was
more probable still, it might be only the pathway used for ages by innumerable
four-footed denizens of the swamp,&#8211;deer, panthers, raccoons, &#8217;possum,
foxes, wildcats and the like.</p>

<p>It was a meandering trail, evidently following the path of least resistance
for on both sides the shrubbery, together with wild grape-vines and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span> various other climbers,
made a solid barrier that even a weasel might have found difficult to
negotiate.</p>

<p>Presently their road skirted the border of the swamp Jack had felt so certain
could not be far away. Here new and wonderful sights greeted their eyes and Perk
in particular stared with all his might, taking in the flowers that festooned
many of the trees&#8211;palmetto, live-oaks, wild plum, gumbo limbo, and queer
looking cypress, with their cumbersome butts rising several feet from the ooze
in which they grew. Most of the trees were festooned with long trailing banners
of gray Spanish moss that gave them a most unusual appearance.</p>

<p>Since it was Perk&#8217;s first hand knowledge concerning the looks of a
genuine Southern swamp, he felt justified in making frequent halts in order to
gaze and wonder. Particularly was he impressed with the giant alligator that had
been sunning himself on a half-submerged log and had slid off with a splash at
their approach, also the multitude of water moccasins to be seen on stumps and
other objects, looking most vicious with their checkered backs and dusty
bellies.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to take particular notice of those dirty looking boys,&#8221;
Jack told him in a low tone, pointing to a bunch of the reptiles as he spoke,
&#8220;for they are water moccasins, cowardly enough, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span> but always ready to give you a sly stab
and I&#8217;ve been told they are so poisonous that even if a man didn&#8217;t
die after being struck, his wound would never heal properly and his life become
a burden to him. Give the critters a wide berth always, partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! you jest better believe I will, Jack&#8211;never did care much
for snakes, even the harmless kinds an&#8217; I&#8217;d jump three feet in the
air when out West, if ever I heard a locust buzz, thinkin&#8217; it must be a
rattler. Me an&#8217; the crawlin&#8217; breed don&#8217;t mix, that&#8217;s
what.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly three minutes after Perk had given expression to his dislikes, Jack
caught him by the arm and with a trace of excitement that was really foreign to
his nature, pointed to some object close to the trail they were following.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeru-salem crickets!&#8221; gasped Jack, possibly a bit louder than
discretion would warrant but Jack felt there was some measure of excuse for his
outburst.</p>

<p>There a monstrous diamondback rattlesnake, fully five feet long and as thick
through the body as a good-sized man&#8217;s thigh, had just raised its enormous
flat head and opened its jaws to display its terrible fangs. Even as the two
stood there and stared, the rattle began to whirr its deadly warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Perk,&#8221; said Jack soothingly, not <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span> certain what the effect
of so dangerous a neighbor might have upon his sensitive pal, &#8220;we can pass
him by out of reach. A rattler, unless madly in earnest, never tries to strike
further than his length for he has to get back in his coil in a hurry, being
helpless to defend himself unless curled up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack showed that this was true by passing the spot, with the venomous reptile
only increasing his rattle and drawing back his head. Then Perk shut his teeth
hard and followed suit but it might have been noticed that he kept to the
extreme edge of the narrow trail and had his muscles all set, as if in readiness
to make a mighty spring if he thought the snake was about to launch his coils
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; hissed Perk, after he had safely negotiated the peril
that lay in the road, &#8220;I&#8217;m a&#8217;thinkin&#8217; what risks we got to run
tonight when we come a&#8217;snoopin&#8217; &#8217;long this way. Nigh makes my hair curl to
figure on that baby comin&#8217; slap up against my leg. Wish now I had my old
leather huntin&#8217; leggings with me to ward off them terrible fangs, each one
an inch long, seemed like to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Between us, brother, I myself don&#8217;t seem to hanker traveling
along this trail after dark, and I mean to carry that small flash of mine,
turning the light on every few seconds for I don&#8217;t believe <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span> it would be noticed. But
they tell me these whoppers are rather scarce around these sections&#8211;there
may not be another inside of five miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory! I should hope not,&#8221; said the still trembling Perk,
&#8220;but I just can&#8217;t forget we&#8217;ve got even one here to bother us.
If only I dared use my gun, I&#8217;d soon knock spots out o&#8217; him, bet you
a cookey, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing, so forget that, partner. On the way back, if he&#8217;s
still holding the fort, we might get a couple of long, stout poles, and try to
knock him on the head if it can be done with little confusion&#8211;he
won&#8217;t make any noise outside of whirling his rattlebox and we could keep
our lips buttoned tight. Yes, that would be the best way to fix things, I
reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Really Jack was saying this so as to comfort his mate; he realized that Perk
had received a severe shock at sight of the diamondback crawler and it might
affect his desire to do any prowling around after nightfall which would throw
the entire burden of so doing on his, Jack&#8217;s shoulders. Besides, there was
a fair chance that the snake would have withdrawn from his self-imposed task of
guardian of the swamp trail and taken himself off to other pastures.</p>

<p>They resumed their forward progress, with Perk keeping a watchful eye out for
other lurking perils&#8211;how were they to know but that an <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span> angry bobcat, bent on
disputing this invasion of his tangled realm, might make a sudden spring from
some limb of a live oak and land upon their backs to commence using his keen
claws, tearing and stripping and snarling like a devil, such as these beasts
always were reckoned in such sections of the country as he, Perk, had
hunted.</p>

<p>Ten minutes, fifteen, passed then Jack again caught his chum&#8217;s arm and
with a finger pressed on his own lips to betoken the necessity for silence,
pointed to something ahead that must have just caught his attention. And Perk,
looking, saw a sight that afforded him a sense of satisfaction both deep and
profound.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MYSTERIOUS COQUINA SHACK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Hot Ziggetty! so <i>this</i> is where he dropped down, is it?&#8221;
Perk was muttering in subdued excitement as his astonished eyes fell upon a
plane bobbing on its pontoons in a sheltered little cove, &#8220;meet that
spruce Lockheed-Vega bus, partner, that clipped past away over our heads,
an&#8217; the woozy pilot never dreamin&#8217; our crate was within a hundred
miles o&#8217; him. Kinder guess the pirate roost must lie around here
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a dead sure thing, Perk,&#8221; whispered Jack,
&#8220;and chances are it&#8217;s hid in the midst of that live-oak clump
yonder, where I take it the land lies high and dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swan but this is gettin&#8217; real excitin&#8217; an&#8217; suits
me okay,&#8221; breathed the duly thrilled Perk, who felt there was no longer
any reason for calling things tame.</p>

<p>&#8220;By changing our base a bit,&#8221; suggested Jack almost as equally
pleased over their success as his nervous chum, &#8220;we might even be able to
get a squint at the shack, let&#8217;s try, buddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lost no time in creeping inch by inch along <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span> toward the right, having apparently
figured out that such a course would give them a better all-around opportunity
to gratify their curiosity.</p>

<p>It proved to be a wise move for presently they managed to glimpse what seemed
to be the corner of a small cottage, built of coquina rock and altogether
attractive in appearance, proving that the Big Boss never hesitated to spend
money when he could secure results.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; gurgled Perk, stretching his neck so as to see better
through the narrow opening that served them as a lookout, &#8220;some toney,
strikes me, considerin&#8217; the desolate country round-about this section.
Must be his high-hat tastes foller him, no matter where he goes&#8211;sorter
dude, I&#8217;d call him, partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; agreed Jack, &#8220;I understood he ran in that
groove but just the same they say this Kearns is a real he-man an&#8217; can put
up a warm scrap when necessary&#8211;the dude racket is only a thin veneer
hiding the genuine article. I was warned never to let him get a chance to beat
me to the draw&#8211;some call him a rattlesnake, only he lacks that
reptile&#8217;s honesty in always giving warning when about to strike.
Don&#8217;t forget, Perk, in dealing with this slick article you&#8217;ve got to
be on your guard every minute of the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you told me that, Jack, I might a&#8217;been <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span> fooled, an&#8217; treated him as a soft
guy. Looky thar, will you, boy&#8211;two&#8211;three fellers jest swarmed out
o&#8217; the shack an&#8217; gone into a huddle like they had some sorter game
to set up. Wonder now if one o&#8217; the bunch could be <i>him</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon not, Perk,&#8221; came in a low tone from Jack, whose head
was only a few inches away from the other&#8217;s, &#8220;none of them answer
the description that was given to me. I even saw a snapshot taken of several
society folks in front o&#8217; his Miami castle, with him standing in the
center. One of this lot&#8217;s the flying man connected with that
crate&#8211;you can see he&#8217;s still wearing his greasy dungarees and has
his helmet on his head, like he expected to be hopping-off any minute now; a
second chap is short and thick, not at all like the one we&#8217;ve come so far
to buck up against, while the third, while tall, looks like a roughneck skipper
of a speedboat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you hit the nail on the head, Jack,&#8221; muttered the
convinced Perk, for they were at some little distance away from the consulting
trio, and their whispers could never have been heard with the dead leaves on
nearby palmetto trees keeping up their harsh clashing when whipped by the gusts
of wind.</p>

<p>Both of the spies must have had a host of speculations passing in review
through their active minds as they lay there watching the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span> conspirators so earnestly talking and
gesticulating. From time to time Jack and his chum would cast further glances in
the quarter where the trim aircraft lay anchored, bobbing up and down like a
restive horse eager to be off.</p>

<p>What did they fetch on their voyage through the upper air lanes, coming from
some unknown port&#8211;hardly &#8220;case stuff,&#8221; Jack told himself,
since space aboard the Lockheed-Vega crate would be limited&#8211;then it must
be either yellow Chinks trying to crash the gates of the country that banned
some of their race as undesirable aliens, or possibly the winged courier carried
a batch of precious stones from far-away Paris, forwarded in a round-about,
surreptitious way and intended to reach a ready market in the wealthiest country
in the world, of course, without paying the usual heavy customs duty&#8211;which
saving alone would likely reach well into six figures.</p>

<p>The trio seemed to have finished their discussion, whatever its nature might
have been, for they sauntered down to the edge of the water where the man in the
dungarees proceeded to embark by means of a small boat that he could leave
secured to the mooring rope of the amphibian when he took off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Making off to pick up another cargo, I reckon,&#8221; Jack ventured.
&#8220;And so this is where <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_179'></a>179</span> our friend has his secret hideout at such times
when he so mysteriously disappears from his big show place near Miami? Mighty
interesting, I&#8217;d call it and the chances are he&#8217;s been keeping up
this double play racket for many months, perhaps even for years, for he came to
Florida not long after the war, fishing for tarpon down around the Ten Thousand
Islands where we lay concealed lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the big idea, partner?&#8221; Perk wanted to
know&#8211;&#8220;why under the sun does he play both ends o&#8217; this queer
game&#8211;what&#8217;s the sense o&#8217; his havin&#8217; this wee shack in
the wilderness when he could carry on his racket just as well on the eastern
shore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just because he fancies the idea of keeping his two personalities as
far apart as possible, Perk. Uncle Sam&#8217;s Coast Guards, revenue officers
and even Secret Service men fairly swarm around Miami most of the year so
they&#8217;d be apt to make it more or less unpleasant for the elegant Oswald
Kearns in his society functions if he had his pals dodging in and out of his
princely palace. He prefers to drop over here in this desolate place instead
when he has a lot of business to transact. He&#8217;s a wonder, all right, in
his double line, Perk, and not to be underrated, understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems that way, partner,&#8221; grumbled the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span> other quickly adding, &#8220;there goes
the Lockheed-Vega spinnin&#8217; out o&#8217; the lagoon to the open lake
so&#8217;s to get up enough speed for the take-off. Must be somethin&#8217;
mighty special to coax that pilot to risk bein&#8217; seen in open daylight. So
he used to fish in them passages &#8217;tween the mangrove islands years ago, did he,
Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure did, and they told me his guide some years ago down there used to
be a notorious smuggler and gulf-stream pirate, no other than Jim Alderman,
right now in the jug over at Fort Lauderdale on the eastern shore and waiting to
get a hempen collar for murdering three law officers in August two years back.
Of course, he hadn&#8217;t started his real career of crime when he used to be a
guide for Roosevelt, Zane Grey, the writer, and some other famous
sportsmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do tell,&#8221; murmured Perk, duly thrilled by what his pal was
telling him concerning one of the most turbulent characters known along the
Florida coasts since those days of old when buccaneers like Blackbeard,
Gasparilla and others of their ilk roamed the subtropical waters and swarmed
aboard such unfortunate Spanish galleons as chance threw their way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised,&#8221; Jack went on to whisper,
&#8220;if he goes under quite another name while over in this hideout and even
manages to alter his looks more or less. He&#8217;s capable of playing <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span> many parts if he&#8217;s
half as good an actor as I suspect. But we&#8217;ll be apt to know a heap more
before a great while slips by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes, Jack, swingin&#8217; off toward the east in the
bargain, but then it&#8217;s just as easy for a flier to strike across the lower
end o&#8217; Florida, if the notion strikes him, day or night. Crates are
gettin&#8217; to be a common sight these days down here. I read they expected to
have a full hundred at Miami this very winter, takin&#8217; part in a big air
derby that&#8217;s scheduled to be pulled off.&#8221;</p>

<p>They watched the other two men walk back and enter the coquina bungalow and a
little later Jack was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Strikes me we&#8217;d better pull up stakes and clear out of this,
Perk, don&#8217;t forget we&#8217;ve got to pass that rattlesnake cove on the
way back, and for one, I&#8217;m not so keen about doing it in pitch
darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me goofy, partner,&#8221; whimpered Perk with a
shudder. &#8220;But hold on a bit&#8211;mebbe now somethin&#8217;s a&#8217;goin&#8217;
to strike up we&#8217;ll both be sorter glad to set eyes on&#8211;looky there,
old hoss, what do you see?&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MAN OF MANY FACES</span></h2>

<p>A man had come out of the odd-looking shack constructed from the coquina rock
found in different parts of Florida, and formed by insects, science has decided.
Neither Jack nor his companion had ever set eyes on him before, he was an
entirely different personage from the short party and the longer-limbed man they
had so lately been watching before the reckless pilot of the Lockheed-Vega plane
departed toward the east.</p>

<p>This individual was also tall and was dressed in well-worn outing garments
that gave him the appearance of a man of leisure taking a day off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think that&#8217;s this here Kearns, partner?&#8221; whispered Perk,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just who it must be, Perk,&#8221; came the cautious reply. &#8220;Be
careful about making any sort of little move that might catch his attention, and
keep your eyes fastened on him. Whatever under the sun is he doing, I
wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks to me he&#8217;s got some sorter bird there&#8211;I c&#8217;n see red
feathers&#8211;yep, that&#8217;s what it is for a fact, Jack!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>&#8220;Working
over a bird with red feathers,&#8221; said Jack, as if to himself, so low was
his voice. &#8220;Now, that makes me remember something I was told only a short
time back&#8211;something connected with that wonderful place he owns over on
the East Coast&#8211;about birds too&#8211;stuffed birds, in fact!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean he&#8217;s got a collection there, Jack?&#8221; breathed
the intently watching assistant in his companion&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that,&#8221; came the ready reply, &#8220;a mighty fine
collection too, from all accounts, of native Florida birds and filling a number
of glass cases. We already know this party is a man of contradictory habits,
being one thing among society people and just the opposite when he gets in a
different atmosphere. Chances are he&#8217;s a pretty fine amateur
taxidermist&#8211;those birds have all been secured by himself and mounted in
the bargain&#8211;that when he drops out of sight around Miami it&#8217;s to
come over here to do some hunting in the swamps and the Everglades, eager to run
across some rare bird that he needs to make his collection complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now wouldn&#8217;t that jar you?&#8221; he gasped, vastly astonished
at hearing Jack air his conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not much of an authority on rare birds,&#8221; Jack admitted
softly as he continued to use his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_184'></a>184</span> eyes to advantage, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got a
hunch that skin he&#8217;s handling right now might be a roseate
spoonbill&#8211;I&#8217;m sure it isn&#8217;t a red ibis, for the bill seems
different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee! sounds queer to me, I must say Jack&#8211;such a man, such a
man&#8211;to play so many different parts! Say, d&#8217;ye know I kinder guess
he ain&#8217;t such a tough guy under all the varnish&#8211;must have a heap
o&#8217; human natur&#8217; under it all to fall for such a decent game as
taxidecentry or whatever you call this pluggin&#8217; dead birds an&#8217;
makin&#8217; &#8217;em sit up on boughs like they might be all to the
good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it mostly on that war experience he went through, Perk&#8211;they
say once a man was gassed pretty badly over there, he&#8217;d always prove to be
a queer fish&#8211;changeable, nervous and apt to do all manner of strange
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But see here, partner,&#8221; whispered Perk, uneasily, &#8220;that
ain&#8217;t a&#8217;goin to make any perticular difference with our billet, is
it&#8211;jest &#8217;cause he&#8217;s got this funny streak runnin&#8217; through his
doin&#8217;s we don&#8217;t reckon to throw up our hands an&#8217; call it all
off, do we?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any, buddy&#8211;we only know that Uncle Sam wants his activities
cut short&#8211;it may be exciting sport for him to ferry Chinks across from
Cuba or Honduras, land big cargoes of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_185'></a>185</span> booze on our shores with his thumb to his nose
insofar as the Government is concerned, and such capers as that, but it means
heaps of trouble for the revenue boys as well as holding our laws up to
contempt. He must be brought to book, and his game stopped without any more
delay than is necessary, no matter how many other innocent recreations
he&#8217;s engaged in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot ziggetty! that gives me a warm feelin&#8217; again, partner
an&#8217; I guess we&#8217;re the boys to knock the underpinnin&#8217; loose
so&#8217;s to make him drop with a splash.&#8221; Saying which, Perk relapsed
into utter silence.</p>

<p>For some further time they stuck it out, watching every little movement of
the remarkable character proceeding with his labor, not a hundred feet distant.
Jack himself began to grow a bit nervous, for the sun was just hovering above
the western horizon and twilight does not last any length of time in the South.
If they delayed much longer it would mean a walk in the dark over that dangerous
dimly marked trail.</p>

<p>They could have no further doubt concerning the nature of the work that was
giving the suspected man so much genuine pleasure, he had held up the object of
his labor several times so they could plainly identify it as a birdskin with the
most lovely rosy-tinted feathery plumage, long legs and a spoon-shaped bill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>Then greatly to
the relief of the uneasy Perk, the short man came out of the shack and said
something that caused the other to accompany him back, thus clearing the
field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s skip out,&#8221; Jack said softly.</p>

<p>Accordingly both watchers commenced sliding and creeping for all the world
copying the movements of a cat ambushing a feeding sparrow in the back yard of a
suburban place. Although so anxious to get started on their way back to where
they had left their camouflaged ship, neither Jack nor his comrade would take
chances in trying to make haste; they had long ago learned the folly of one
false move when engaged in their accustomed job of spying upon a suspected
law-breaker whom they had tracked down after an arduous chase.</p>

<p>When finally they reached a point where it was safe to pick up a little
speed, Jack hastened to do so. For a wonder Perk was not saying a word&#8211;the
truth was he had his mind so filled with bewilderment in connection with the
queer happenings of the last hour that he could not think of any further
questions to ask his chum.</p>

<p>Then, too, Perk kept on the alert for any peril that might by chance lie in
wait along the trail&#8211;there were other dangers besides that solitary
rattlesnake that might suddenly crop up to give them a chill&#8211;how about
those nasty looking <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_187'></a>187</span> water moccasins that swarmed in the oozy
swamp?&#8211;what of the ferocious bobcats such as were said to crouch on the
lower limb of some tree close beside a woods trail, waiting to drop down on any
moving object that came along?&#8211;yes, and other things just as creepy that
his excited mind could readily conjure up?</p>

<p>They were, as Perk judged, about halfway to the spot where they had seen Mr.
Rattler earlier in the day and the dusk was certainly beginning to make all
objects look more or less dim, when Jack suddenly stopped, giving Perk quite a
shock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; Jack was saying huskily.</p>

<p>A far-away and faint buzzing sound came to Perk&#8217;s ears but instead of
adding to his excitement it really seemed to cool his blood, for surely this had
nothing whatever to do with snakes of any kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! must be a crate partner!&#8221; bubbled the relieved Perk.</p>

<p>&#8220;No question about that, Perk, and growing clearer right along, showing
it&#8217;s heading this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe the Lockheed-Vega comin&#8217; back again?&#8221; ventured
Perk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly likely,&#8221; he was told instantly, &#8220;For one thing
you&#8217;ll notice this motor racket swings <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_188'></a>188</span> up to us from the southwest, while the other ship
struck off toward the east.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s straight goods,&#8221; Perk hastened to admit.
&#8220;Funny I didn&#8217;t get on to that right away. Means our gent has a raft
o&#8217; ships comin&#8217; an&#8217; goin&#8217; when he takes a notion to drop
over here once in a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t stop to listen any longer,&#8221; said Jack again
starting off with the other trailing close at his heels.</p>

<p>The buzzing grew rapidly in volume, proving that no matter where the
advancing plane came from, its destination must be that secluded little cove
close to the coquina shack sheltering the man of many faces, who went from
fields of excitement to those connected with society functions, entertaining
guests in royal style or following his favorite pursuit along the enchanting
line of adding to his prized collection of Florida birds. Presently Perk heard a
splash and knew the amphibian must have reached its goal.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A PUGNACIOUS RATTLER</span></h2>

<p>In good time they reached the narrow point on the animal trail which marked
the scene of their adventure with the rattlesnake. Perk, wishing to be prepared
for anything that might greet them, had picked up a stout cudgel with which he
believed he could give a good account of himself should the occasion arise.</p>

<p>But they passed the place and he was beginning to breathe easier when he was
thrilled by a brisk and ominous sound from just ahead. Instinctively Perk
clutched his chum by the arm and dragged him back a pace although this was
really unnecessary, since Jack had stopped walking at the same instant as
Perk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh all hemlock!&#8221; broke out Perk, &#8220;what d&#8217;ye think
o&#8217; that&#8211;jest awaitin&#8217; round for us to come along&#8211;what a
&#8217;commodatin&#8217; little pet he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack could see the suggestive bulk of the coiled snake lying on the path,
with scant room on either side for them to pass&#8211;oozy depths of <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span> the swamp on one side
and an angry rattler on the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just blocks our game whichever way you choose to look at it,&#8221;
chuckled Jack with a shrug. &#8220;If we were monkeys, we could shin up a tree
and climb over to that other one beyond, but since we&#8217;re neither simians
nor fox squirrels, we&#8217;ll have to settle this thing some other way. Drop
that club, brother&#8211;it&#8217;s too short for this business by three feet.
To try and use it on that chap you&#8217;d have to step up within range of his
spring and before you could get in your lick it&#8217;d all be over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest as you say, partner,&#8221; remarked Perk, throwing the stocky
club away. &#8220;Wait up for me, Jack, an&#8217; don&#8217;t let him skin out
till I get back. I saw a stick just back a bit that ought to fill the bill
okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack stood on guard and waited but not for long, since Perk speedily rejoined
him, carrying a pole about eight feet in length and stout in proportion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful how you work it,&#8221; advised Jack, who would rather have
done the job himself but knew he would not be allowed by the ambitious one.</p>

<p>As Perk slowly advanced, waving his pole, the coiled serpent displayed signs
of redoubled anger&#8211;louder buzzed his rattle while he drew <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span> back his flat head as
though in readiness for action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold it there, buddy!&#8221; snapped Jack. &#8220;Now get a firm grip
on your pole and draw back for a vicious rap&#8211;you&#8217;ve got to get him
square in the middle and follow it up with more whacks in a big hurry.
Don&#8217;t step any closer whatever you do. Now, give him fits,
Perk!&#8221;</p>

<p>This the other proceeded to do with might and main. The sprightly buzz
suddenly ceased as the great folds of the monster began to squirm and
writhe&#8211;Perk lifted his pole and put in another blow for good measure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8211;guess now he&#8217;s got his for keeps,&#8221; gasped the
victor in the singular duel as he managed to get in a third and deciding stroke
that crushed the flat head of the reptile and forever ended its capacity for
business.</p>

<p>They were soon bending over the still squirming snake, Perk eagerly measuring
its length by footing it off and announcing it to be just one inch over five
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme just a minute so&#8217;s to whip off that bully rattle,
partner,&#8221; he was saying as he produced a big pocketknife and opened its
large blade. &#8220;I want it to show if any guy ever questions the truth
o&#8217; my yarn &#8217;bout these here Florida rattlers. There you are,
an&#8217; now I&#8217;m ready to move on. But we got to keep our eyes peeled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span> &#8217;cause I been told
these critters nearly allers have a mate somewhere near by. An&#8217; I&#8217;m
meanin&#8217; to hang on to this bully pole, since we got to come back this way
more&#8217;n a few times, seems like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing else cropped up to disturb their peace of mind and in due time the
pair arrived at the secluded lagoon where they had left their aircraft so
artfully concealed. Apparently nothing had happened in this quarter since they
started forth on their mission, and yet what strange things had they not seen
inside those few hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems like supper&#8217;d come in fair good jest new,&#8221; Perk
remarked after they had climbed carefully aboard and were once more comfortably
seated in their accustomed places, &#8220;but sorry to say it&#8217;s bound to
be only a &#8217;pology for real grub&#8211;dry fare and never even a drop o&#8217;
water to wash it down with.&#8221; And he emitted a disgusted grunt, as if to
display a proper amount of displeasure over the doleful fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed a well of some sort just back of that shack,&#8221; remarked
Jack as if he too, shared in this moan over the absence of drinking water.
&#8220;When we go back we&#8217;ll try and snatch a drink apiece so as to take
the rusty feeling out of our throats. Until then we&#8217;ll have to put up with
it, partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Necessity knows no law and so Perk was compelled to grin and bear it. Just
the same, as they <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
were munching their simple fare,&#8211;and little of that in the
bargain&#8211;Jack could hear him muttering to himself and chuckling from time
to time as though he managed to squeeze more or less pleasure in simply mulling
over a multitude of his favorite dishes until one would have imagined it was a
waiter in a cheap eating joint down on the Bowery enumerating what the house
offered for dinner&#8211;<i>a la</i> O. Henry.</p>

<p>Later on Perk gave signs of being what he called dopey, whereupon Jack asked
whether he felt inclined to start out again or should it be left to just one of
them&#8211;meaning himself, of course,&#8211;to undertake the further job of
spying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much you don&#8217;t monopolize the fun,&#8221; Perk told him
point blank. &#8220;I&#8217;m bound to step along with you even if there&#8217;d
be a legion o&#8217; them rattlebugs lyin&#8217; in the trail awaitin&#8217; to
sting us. When I get started on anything I gen&#8217;rally keeps right on with it,
even if I have to wade through hell-fire. An&#8217; that goes, partner,
see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d say that, brother,&#8221; Jack assured him, seeing
Perk act as though hurt by the insinuation that anything would tempt him to let
his pal meet the danger alone. &#8220;If you feel a bit empty down below, just
rub your tummy briskly, then pull in your belt a notch or two and it&#8217;ll
make you imagine you&#8217;re full-up to the brim. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span> I&#8217;ll be ready to start off inside
another ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack spent most of this time rummaging around in the locker where he kept his
own personal belongings. Perk knew when he got out that little but valuable hand
flashlight, by means of which they expected to be able to keep on the winding
and narrow trail when heading once more toward the lonesome coquina shack on the
border of the great inland sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m up in the air when it comes to knowin&#8217; what else
he&#8217;s stuck in his pockets,&#8221; Perk told himself, though somehow he
managed to refrain from asking questions nor did Jack seem anxious to enter into
any explanations.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave things here all fixed so as to make a quick
take-off,&#8221; was what the chief pilot remarked as they prepared to step
ashore and while he did not see fit to offer any explanation with regard to just
what he had in mind, Perk felt thrilled to believe there was already some daring
plan taking form in his comrade&#8217;s wide-awake brain that might be carried
out if only the conditions seemed favorable, and the weather proved
considerate.</p>

<p>As they walked slowly along Jack kept frequently snapping his light on and
off so that they could take an instantaneous inventory of what lay just beyond
their feet for the night <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_195'></a>195</span> proved exceedingly dark although all that would be
changed after a while, when the late moon climbed into sight.</p>

<p>Perk, just as he promised himself, had made certain to pick up that
serviceable pole with which he had dispatched the rattlesnake and this he kept
poking out ahead, as if to stir up any lurking reptile that might be lying
coiled in the path.</p>

<p>His nervousness increased as they drew near the spot where the one-sided
fight had taken place. He had apparently been brooding over the matter,
wondering if the mate of his victim could have come upon the scene of the
tragedy and sensing what had happened, was lurking thereabouts, bent on exacting
a terrible revenge in payment for the untimely demise of her partner.</p>

<p>When he felt certain they had passed this particular narrow part of the
trail, Perk began to breathe easier, but he soon had reason to fear lest he was
crowing too soon for just then he felt Jack buck up against him and heard him
saying in a low but distinct voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold up and listen, partner!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>ON HANDS AND KNEES</span></h2>

<p>Even while Jack was saying those few words, Perk had recovered from his
sudden alarm, since he already knew the reason for the other&#8217;s bringing
him to a halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! that crate&#8217;s startin&#8217; off again, seems like,&#8221;
he muttered.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a foregone certainty for the splash of water told the story as
well as the abrupt explosions of a working motor. Then, too, these suggestive
sounds all came from directly ahead.</p>

<p>Then Perk had another gripping fear which he imagined must have also seized
his companion&#8211;that the chief object of their concern might be a passenger
aboard that ship, heading once more across the state to Miami and that in
consequence, all of Jack&#8217;s carefully laid plans would meet the same
untimely fate as befalls an ambitious soap-bubble when struck by a stray puff of
air.</p>

<p>So they continued to stand there and listen to the telltale sounds with
sinking hearts. Perk in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_197'></a>197</span> particular seemed to be dreadfully put out by this
fresh upset and was grinding his strong teeth as though desirous of letting out
an explosive but restrained by the fact of Jack being so close at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz! this here is what I call tough luck, Boss,&#8221; he
grumbled, more because he hoped Jack might be able to dispel his fit of the
blues in some way or other, having a much clearer vision than he himself
possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t know, partner,&#8221; said Jack in a wholesome,
optimistic tone. &#8220;It looks a little dark, but just wait a minute or so
before you croak&#8211;after all, the thing may not be so bad&#8211;it
doesn&#8217;t pay to jump at conclusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! that&#8217;s me all over, old hoss, but I&#8217;m sure glad to
hear you say the last chance ain&#8217;t snuffed out yet,&#8221; mumbled Perk
contritely, but at least he had gained his point which was to coax Jack to mix a
little good cheer in with the gloom that had descended on his, Perk&#8217;s
soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, he&#8217;s off!&#8221; declared Jack as a significant change in
the clatter so thoroughly understood by any airman announced the hop-off from
the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; nothin&#8217; happened to give him a spill, either,&#8221;
Perk went on to say and the disconsolate vein in his tone told plainly enough
how he had been secretly hugging to his heart a hope that <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span> the motor of the Lockheed-Vega crate
might suddenly develop some fault, compelling the flight to be abandoned in its
inception.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even that fact may yet turn out to be the best thing we could wish
for,&#8221; Jack told him confidently, being built on the order of a fellow who
could see something to rejoice over in nearly every occurrence, no matter how
thick the gloom surrounding it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he swings up an&#8217; is off&#8211;a slick jump, b&#8217;lieve me
an&#8217; that guy&#8217;s some square shooter in the bargain&#8211;knows his
business okay anyway. But Jack, tell me, you don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s got
our man alongside him, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one thing seems to tell me that isn&#8217;t a fact,
Perk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, an&#8217; what might that be?&#8221; demanded the other
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Notice that he&#8217;s already banking, so as to lay his course toward
Cape Sable&#8211;square in the south&#8211;get that, don&#8217;t you
Perk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swan, but you&#8217;re right there, Jack&#8211;which looks kinder
like he didn&#8217;t mean to strike out for Miami, don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than likely he&#8217;s hitting out for Cuba, or if he veers to
the west, it&#8217;s Mexico or Honduras he means to head for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk heaved a big sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot ziggetty! but that sounds good to me, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span> partner,&#8221; he observed with
renewed animation as hope again sang a sweet song in his heart. &#8220;Then
there&#8217;s a real chance he ain&#8217;t got our man alongside.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood there and continued to listen as the sounds made by the flight of
the retreating seaplane gradually grew fainter and even for brief spells died
out altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s out o&#8217; the pictur&#8217; anyhow,&#8221; Perk finally
commented when they could no longer catch the least thud of the working
motor&#8211;only a more pleasing sound in the shape of gentle wavelets running
up the shore of the great lake being borne to their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and since that&#8217;s settled we&#8217;d better be making a
further move ahead,&#8221; Jack was saying, in his sensible way.</p>

<p>Accordingly the advance was renewed, nor did they take any less precaution
because of the departure of the flying boat.</p>

<p>As before, Jack continued to frequently make good use of his little
flashlight, which proved its worth just as had been expected. So speedy were the
flashes that it did not seem possible for any one to notice them unless he
chanced to be on the watch for something suspicious and Jack hardly anticipated
such a thing as that.</p>

<p>Apparently the one who had planned the raid believed there was only one
course for them to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
pursue and that was to keep on as though everything was just as they had hoped.
Even though an adverse Fate chose to cheat them them of their intended prey on
this particular occasion there would be other days to come,&#8211;and had he not
promised to trap his man as well as to procure all needful proof to secure his
conviction?</p>

<p>They were soon drawing close to their goal&#8211;already Jack had glimpsed a
shred of light gleaming through the intervening brush which proved most
conclusively that the shack could not be wholly deserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221; Perk whispered when this comforting fact had been
brought to his attention, &#8220;we&#8217;ll get his goat yet,
partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their progress was slowed up at this point for Jack no longer believed it
good policy to make use of his flashlight. They had to partly feel their way
along, using both hands and feet to detect the presence of any obstacle that was
apt to cause them trouble.</p>

<p>Still, the night was long and there was no desire to make haste&#8211;if they
waited until those in the shack were apt to be sound asleep it would be much
easier to carry out their plan of campaign without any chance of
interruption.</p>

<p>Now they could get faint glimpses of the little cove, which the visiting
planes were wont to use <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_201'></a>201</span> as a hiding place, taxiing thither after splashing
down on the surface of the nearby lake.</p>

<p>Perk made a mental note of the fact that the cove was quite empty, no hostile
crate bobbing up and down on the water&#8211;possibly this induced the dreamer
to indulge in a hope that should the occasion warrant such a thing, they might
taxi their own ship around and make use of that snug harbor safe from any
ordinary gale that chanced to strike treacherous Okeechobee.</p>

<p>Now they could see the light much better and even make out that it came from
a certain window of the coquina shack&#8211;up to then Perk acknowledged to
himself that he had not known whether the modest little building boasted of
windows or not, having discovered no evidence of their presence.</p>

<p>So, too, he now made but a certain dark spot just beyond the shack which he
strongly suspected might be the well shed of which the more observant Jack had
spoken earlier in one of their pow-wows.</p>

<p>Now that he found himself so near the spot where it seemed likely he could
refresh his dry throat with a cup of fresh water, Perk was growing wild with the
eager desire to be doing so. He Wondered whether his companion could have
forgotten his promise and even opened his mouth to remind him concerning it but
thought better <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span> of
it for already Jack had changed the line of his advance and was beginning to
steer his pal in the direction of the well.</p>

<p>In order not to take any unnecessary chances it was found that they must make
a little detour in order to get past that shaft of light proceeding from the
window in the rear of the shack. Perk even begrudged the brief time taken in
making this half circuit, though recognizing the wisdom governing Jack&#8217;s
change of course. He dared not try to whisper now, lest his hoarseness cause him
to make a sound so harsh and loud that it might be carried to hostile ears and
be the cause of their undoing.</p>

<p>Then, after another delay when Jack imagined he had caught a suspicious
little scratching sound, as of something moving, they drew up on hands and knees
alongside what seemed to be a rustic shelter covering an opening with a real
windlass, rope and all, to fill Perk&#8217;s heart with joy in the belief that
his throat was in a fair way of having its roughness relieved in short
order.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>PERK DEMANDS MORE WATER</span></h2>

<p>It was queer what chanced to be passing through the mind of Jack Ralston
while they were thus creeping toward the little well in the rear of the lonesome
shack on the bank of Okeechobee. He had been reading a novel that was supposed
to cover the famous and successful attempt on the part of General Fred Funston
to penetrate the mighty wilderness in the north of Luzon, the main island of the
Philippine group and effect the capture of the native rebel chieftain, Aguinaldo
who, with some of his associates, had taken refuge in a lonely cabin at a most
inaccessible point.</p>

<p>So vividly had the author described the manner in which the soldier and his
companions crept up when making ready to seize their prey, that it was still
haunting the mind of the airman and somehow the conditions just then confronting
himself and Perk seemed to be very similar. He only hoped they would prove to be
just as successful in their mission as Funston was when he carried Aguinaldo
back to Manila, and thus <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span> broke the backbone of the native uprising against
the authority of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>Perk was already reaching out toward the bucket he discovered perched on the
rocky border of the well. Jack could hear him give a chuckle of satisfaction on
rinding it half full of water and felt himself a bit tickled to see the way in
which his chum proceeded to greedily fill up with the precious liquid.</p>

<p>Little Perk cared if the water chanced to be stale&#8211;he had no complaint
coming on that score as long as his parched throat and tongue came in for a good
soaking and the choking sensation was immediately relieved.</p>

<p>Perk must have suddenly remembered his lapse of manners, for in the midst of
his drinking spree he stopped short and stepped back as though to invite his
comrade to take his turn.</p>

<p>This Jack showed no hesitation in doing, drinking long and with considerable
ardor though he knew when to stop, which was what Perk did not for no sooner had
the other released his hold on the bucket than Perk took another turn.</p>

<p>In the end Jack was compelled to almost drag the other away from the well
possibly for fear he burst or else some one come out of the shack and discover
them prowling there, unwelcome <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_205'></a>205</span> intruders on Oswald Kearns&#8217; privacy and a
positive threat to his peace of mind.</p>

<p>It was hardly a time and place for doing any talking, no matter how subdued
their voices. Jack kept hold of the other&#8217;s arm and thus started to steer
him in the direction of the lighted window.</p>

<p>Perk must have guessed what his pal had in mind for he made no resistance
whatever, just allowed himself to be steered as his comrade wished. Stooping
down they crawled past, and then closer until they could begin to glimpse the
interior of the room where the light was dispelling the darkness.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck Jack was the fact that the place had been fixed
up with an eye to comfort&#8211;it looked almost luxurious with its easy chairs
and imported rugs that must have cost a considerable sum. Evidently Oswald
Kearns had been too long accustomed to comfort to deny himself such luxuries
even when seeking seclusion in this out-of-the-way retreat.</p>

<p>Then Jack found himself looking upon the man who had for years been one of
the greatest mysteries the Treasury Department at Washington had ever endeavored
to trap, He was sitting in a big leather-covered easy-chair, smoking a cigar and
busily engaged with a sheaf of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_206'></a>206</span> important looking papers. From time to time he
would refer to a volume that had the appearance of a ledger or account book and
to which he seemed to attach great importance.</p>

<p>How the sight sent a succession of thrills through the whole being of the
Secret Service sleuth&#8211;here he found himself within arms length of the
master crook who had laughed to scorn all previous efforts of the Government to
take him with the goods on.</p>

<p>Vainly had every possible attempt been made to catch him off his guard; he
had proved himself to be too crafty for the best revenue officers put upon his
track. And when failure after failure became the rule, the Big Boss had decided
to change the policy they had hitherto followed and put an air pilot on the job
as being able to go swiftly and easily where others had been so cleverly
balked.</p>

<p>Then Jack began to wonder where the other two men might be, for thus far he
had failed to discover either in the room of the lighted window. Could it be
possible both of them had sailed away aboard that Lockheed-Vega ship, bent on
some important mission which the Master had entrusted to their care?</p>

<p>He could not bring himself to believe this possible&#8211;that he against
whom so many hostile <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_207'></a>207</span> hands were raised would be willing to stay all by
himself in such a lonesome place unless it seemed unavoidable. One or both of
those aids must be somewhere around.</p>

<p>Just the same he could see no other room connected with the stone
building&#8211;it was always possible, however, that there might be another
shack&#8211;perhaps a crude palmetto-leaf hut, such as the poor whites in the
backwoods lived in, somewhere not far away that served them for a shelter when
it rained or a bustling Norther came howling down from the regions of snow and
ice and zero temperatures.</p>

<p>Jack had about reached this conclusion when he discovered a figure, covered
with a fancy Navajo blanket, on a cot in a corner of the place&#8211;yes, there
was a head on a sofa pillow such as would be more in place over at the beautiful
Miami estate than here in such a desolate region.</p>

<p>Somehow he quickly assumed this must be the shorter party&#8211;which would
go to prove the other fellow might have accompanied the pilot of the departed
airship.</p>

<p>When he had decided this to his entire satisfaction, Jack was able to figure
on certain matters. It undoubtedly meant that he and Perk would have just two
pitted against them in case <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_208'></a>208</span> things came to a showdown, making it an even fight
with victory perching on the side that was quickest at the draw.</p>

<p>He seemed to remember every warning he had received in connection with not
under-rating this remarkable man, so greedy for excitement that wealthy though
he was, he would seek all manner of thrilling adventures just to have the laugh
on the Government, especially the Secret Service men toward whom he was said to
entertain a feeling of almost wolfish hatred.</p>

<p>So too, did Jack take note of every object spread before his searching gaze
in the shack where Oswald Kearns seemed to be busying himself in the pleasing
occupation of making up his secret accounts.</p>

<p>That book, as well as the sheaf of papers rather fascinated the watcher
outside the window&#8211;somehow Jack conceived the idea that there before him
was spread all the incriminating evidence needful to bring the erratic career of
this amazing man to an abrupt end&#8211;to put a stop to the mammoth illegal
operations he had so long conducted in secret and by which he had impudently
flaunted all the powers in Washington, just as though he had sent them a message
worded, &#8220;Well, what are you going to do about it? Break up this fine game
if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>If only they
were able to get him fast in the net before he could make any attempt to destroy
that book and those papers&#8211;Jack felt convinced a generous Fortune had not
allowed him to see such a prize only to snatch it out of his reach through fire
or some similar means of destruction.</p>

<p>But here was Perk pulling at his sleeve as though he had a communication of
the utmost importance to pass along. Accordingly, Jack, who himself was ready to
effect a change of base so that speedy action might be decided on, moved back
from the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Perk?&#8221; he whispered, at which the other began to
make suggestive gestures toward his throat, and nod his head violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I c&#8217;n feel it comin&#8217; on again, partner&#8211;the ticklin&#8217;
feelin&#8217; you know, an&#8217; I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll start
acoughin&#8217; to beat the band&#8211;must have more drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed nothing could be done until Perk&#8217;s sensitive throat had been
properly attended to, so once more they crept and trailed along until the
vicinity of the well had been reached. Here Perk started to swill, as though his
capacity for holding water had no limit. It was just at this particular moment,
when both of them were hanging over the well curb that a shaft of light <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span> suddenly enveloped them
as the back door of the shack opened and the figure of the short man came in
sight with a new tin or aluminum bucket in his hand as though his purpose was to
get a supply of fresh water.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FIGHT AT THE WELL.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk hissed this one word even as he ducked down behind the well curbing at
sight of the figure in the doorway. Jack was not a breath behind him, both
acting through mere intuition or instinct.</p>

<p>Whether they had been seen was the important question flashing through the
mind of each. There was no sudden outcry which seemed a favorable sign, Jack
decided and the short, muscular man was even then emerging from the interior of
the shack, evidently bent on replenishing the drinking water supply.</p>

<p>Perk thrust his eager hand into the pocket of his leather jacket to grip his
automatic with the idea that he would be needing it before many more seconds had
ticked off. In his mind he entertained a comprehensive view of what their plan
of action would most likely be&#8211;to down this husky chap, either by means of
a blow or else a bit of lead delivered where it would do the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span> most good&#8211;then a
swift rush into the shack and crushing the ex-war veteran before he could fully
grasp the meaning of it all.</p>

<p>Easy enough to figure it out after this manner, but there must be
considerable chance that matters would not work so smoothly. For one thing it
must be considered that Oswald Kearns was no weakling, but a more or less
athletic figure, accustomed to feats of strength and agility beyond the measure
of an ordinary man. Then, too, he was known to be irrational, even to the length
of being considered dangerous when thoroughly aroused and it went without saying
that he must always be well armed for in his reckless way of living he must many
times be in close touch with desperate characters, some of whom might conceive
it worth while to plot against his liberty, with a heavy ransom in their
mind&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>It was quite too late for either of them to think of slipping off, since the
light from the interior of the shack poured through the open door and dissipated
the friendly darkness in that especial vicinity.</p>

<p>Consequently all they could do was to continue to crouch there in the shadow
of the well curbing, and await whatever was scheduled to come to pass.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>If Perk had been
so eagerly praying for something to breeze along that would give him the thrill
he loved so well, his wish seemed well on the road of being realized since
everything was set for a dramatic discovery with its attendant speedy
action.</p>

<p>It was apparent that after all the man could not have glimpsed their
vanishing faces as they ducked so swiftly, for he continued to advance in the
direction of the well and Perk could hear him softly singing, just as though he
might be a &#8220;musical cuss,&#8221; as Perk told himself with one of his
customary chuckles since his first stab of alarm had passed off under the
realization that they had another chance.</p>

<p>Jack, too, was telling himself what a peculiar state of affairs had come upon
the stage&#8211;here, with an ambush lying in wait before him, this man could
step blithely along, swinging his aluminum bucket and softly warbling one of the
most recent hits from a comic opera&#8211;Jack had himself heard the song on the
boards of a great metropolitan theatre in New York&#8211;had even caught himself
whistling the catchy air more than a few times since.</p>

<p>The man who seemed to be so well pleased with his fortunes while basking in
the favor of the wealthy chief of smugglers had a little surprise waiting for
him at the end of his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_214'></a>214</span> rainbow&#8211;if those lurking shadowy figures knew
their business and managed it as they should, he would be singing quite a
different air before a great while, perhaps interlarding his humming with a
choice variety of expletives concerning the cruelty of Fate.</p>

<p>A few more steps and he would have reached the well&#8211;then what must take
place? Perk was asking himself as he crouched there, his muscles set and his
breath coming in little noiseless gasps&#8211;he resembled nothing so much as a
cat ready poised to make a deadly leap upon a fat robin struggling with a worm
that it had pulled halfway out of its hole.</p>

<p>There was not one chance in twenty that the man could actually reach the
well, drop the bucket down, switch it around in order to induce water to enter
and then make use of the windlass so as to draw it to the top, without
discovering the presence of those two huddled forms; so Perk did not deceive
himself in the least with any extravagant hopes of the affair passing off
smoothly and their plans being uninterrupted.</p>

<p>Now the man had set his pail down and was giving the well bucket a switch as
though intending to dislodge any stale water it might contain. From this little
incident Jack understood that undoubtedly the man must himself have left the
water they had used up in the bucket <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_215'></a>215</span> when last at the well and subconsciously remembered
the fact.</p>

<p>He went about the job of lowering the rope with the manner of one quite
familiar with the necessary movements, pulling the rope from the barrel of the
windlass hand over hand. Then there came a splash, a gurgle and following these
symptoms of success the man, with a jerk at the rope, managed to sink the
bucket.</p>

<p>Next he started to turn the handle in order to fetch the bucket to the top of
the well. In order to get a better purchase on the handle, he took a step to the
left, and as luck would have it, struck his knee against the crouching form of
Perk.</p>

<p>Then came a quick look downward, since he was naturally curious to know what
sort of object he had collided with&#8211;possibly he may even have had a sudden
suspicion it would turn out to be some native beast from the neighboring
swamp&#8211;possibly a panther, since such animals had been known to frequent
the western shore of Okeechobee as a hunting-ground in days gone by.</p>

<p>Of course he instantly made a startling discovery, since there was enough
light to show him the form of a man doubled up against the rocky well
curbing.</p>

<p>It would have been instinctive for the man to have let out a yell on making
this discovery but <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
he did not have the chance to give tongue, at least fully, for Perk made a
lightning-like spring and had both hands clasped about his throat effectually
throttling the intended shout so that it emerged only as a queer sound, rather
on the order of a bull alligator&#8217;s bellowing suddenly cut short.</p>

<p>That was but the beginning of the affair as Perk knew only too well it must
prove to be. He found he had a tough proposition on his hands for the man
struggled desperately, as who would not on finding his wind suddenly cut
entirely off with a pair of iron-like hands pressing his throat as though it
were gripped in a vise?</p>

<p>Jack sprang up, ready to lend his pal any necessary assistance if only the
opportunity showed itself. Just then all he could make out in the dim light was
a whirling set of wildly struggling figures, looking for all the world like one
of those teetotums children delight in spinning&#8211;only on an exaggerated
scale.</p>

<p>Then they went down with a crash, first one on top and then the other in
rapid succession. It would have made an excellent picture for the silver screen,
Jack could not help thinking while he drew his automatic and kept tabs on that
open door, more than half expecting to see Oswald Kearns dash wildly out with
some sort of machine-gun in his hands, ready to take a <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span> chance in the game, knowing that the
attack must have everything to do with his own safety.</p>

<p>Perk seemed to be hanging on with the tenacity of a bulldog, for not another
peep did the wolfish man, whose throat he squeezed, give vent to as the
slam-bang fight continued. It was lucky indeed there chanced to be a raised wall
about the well or in their frantic staggering this way and that the wrestlers
might have plunged down into the yawning aperture, much to their mutual
discomfiture&#8211;as it was they smashed up against the curbing several times,
to emit grunts at the rough contact.</p>

<p>Finally, Jack, to his relief, saw Perk slam his now weakening adversary to
the ground and immediately follow this up by sending in a number of furious
blows that took every atom of fight out of the unfortunate chap who collapsed as
if wholly done for.</p>

<p>Perk himself was far from fresh&#8211;his breath came in gasps and he must
have been trembling in every joint from the tremendous exertion put forth but as
always, victory was sweet in his nostrils and after assuring himself that
nothing further need be feared from the man he had downed, he struggled to his
feet, and ranged himself alongside Jack, as if to declare his readiness to fight
it out along those lines if it took all night.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AT BAY</span></h2>

<p>Jack had been keeping a watchful eye on the nearby shack, not knowing what
moment a raging figure might come dashing forth armed with a rapid-fire gun and
ready to sweep up the earth with the mangled bodies of himself and Perk.</p>

<p>Somewhat to his surprise, and greatly to his relief as well, nothing of the
kind came to pass. Suddenly he realized that the door of the squatty little
coquina rock building had been closed, for no longer did the light spread a
banner out into the black night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drag him back of the well here, Perk,&#8221; he said softly,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got to make certain he&#8217;ll give us no further trouble.
Got that piece of stout rope I gave you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here, partner&#8211;wrapped around my waist,&#8221; and as he
thus managed to make himself heard, even while so short of breath, Perk caught
hold of the nearest leg of his late antagonist and without the least ceremony
dragged the senseless man several feet just as he might a bag <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span> of meal&#8211;when
head-over-heels in a real scrap Perk counted his opponents as so much junk whose
fate it was to be handled without ceremony and yet after the row was over, no
one could be more solicitous about binding up their hurts than Gabe
Perkiser.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use the rope to fasten his ankles together,&#8221; advised Jack,
standing guard meanwhile with his automatic ready for business and his keen eyes
roving around in search of signs along the trouble line, &#8220;and knot it half
a dozen times so it would take a knife blade to get free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All done up brown and slick, Jack old hoss, now what?&#8221; announced
Perk a minute or so later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clap that new pair of bracelets on his wrists,&#8221; further
explained the head pilot briskly, &#8220;and be sure to frisk him for a gat or
even a knife. You see, we&#8217;re going to have our hands full with the boss
and can&#8217;t fool around with this chap any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His name is Mud!&#8221; scornfully declared Perk briskly as he
completed his task with the manner of one to whom it had become an old
story.</p>

<p>The fellow, it seemed, had recovered his senses for he tried to bite
Perk&#8217;s hand and received a solid thump on the head for his pains.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far, good,&#8221; Jack was saying, half to himself. &#8220;Now
let&#8217;s move along to the house and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_220'></a>220</span> make sure our bird hasn&#8217;t skipped out while
we were so busy at the well here. Got all the drink you want, Perk&#8211;we
can&#8217;t be coming back every little while just to wet your long
neck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay with me, boy, let&#8217;s go,&#8221; the other
announced with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Leaving their prisoner lying there they started an advance on the shack. Both
eyed it carefully as they crept along and it was Perk who noticed the first
favorable sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;Door&#8217;s shut, partner, but the light&#8217;s still on&#8211;you
c&#8217;n lamp a streak down near the sill, think he&#8217;s on deck
yet&#8211;ain&#8217;t cut an&#8217; run like a blue streak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon find out,&#8221; Jack assured him.
&#8220;&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be like a guy with his reputation as a scrapper to clear
out so quick. I&#8217;m wondering whether he&#8217;s fixing up some hot
reception for us when we break in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot ziggetty! that is sure some rummy scrap,&#8221; Perk muttered as
he kept close tabs on the shack now close by as though he more than half
anticipated seeing it suddenly burst into flames, or go up in fragments under
the influence of an explosion.</p>

<p>Now they had reached the door and Jack made a slight effort to open it, but
with no success.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; he whispered to his kneeling mate, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span> &#8220;it&#8217;s got the bar down in
place. Listen and see if you can catch a sound from inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute passed with both straining their hearing to the utmost&#8211;Perk
even laid his head against the closed door so as to better catch any suspicious
sound from within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! guess they ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;, partner,&#8221;
he hissed in a disappointed tone, &#8220;thought I did get a little
ruslin&#8217; sound, like paper bein&#8217; crumpled up when you&#8217;re
a&#8217;makin&#8217; a fire, but don&#8217;t hear it no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paper, you say?&#8221; snapped Jack uneasily, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like that any too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked the other, evidently at a loss to understand why
such a simple little thing like that could annoy any one&#8211;what if the man
at bay figured on setting fire to the hidden little retreat he had arranged here
close to the lonely lake where he could slip away whenever he felt like shunning
those society people over at crowded Miami&#8211;he surely had no intention of
cremating himself and they could nab him if he started to make off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paper&#8211;don&#8217;t you know what he was doing when we peeped
in&#8211;that book ought to be worth its weight in gold to us as evidence and
that stack of papers that he was looking through&#8211;if he&#8217;s given
enough time he may put a match to the bunch and destroy everything that could be
used <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span> against him.
We&#8217;ve got to keep him from doing that, brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8211;but how?&#8221; gasped the other, showing renewed signs of
excitement as he visioned the holocaust with their fine plans going up in fire
and smoke just when they seemed about to corral success.</p>

<p>Jack answered that question by striking the door with his foot, the result
being a loud thump. Then he caught hold of his chum and dragged him to one side.
None too soon was this done, for there came a series of staccato explosions from
inside the shack and tiny gleams of light in various sections of the door told
that bullets had passed through the wood in a number of places. Only for this
prompt action on the part of the cautious one, either or both might have had
leaden pellets lodged promiscuously about their persons with resultant painful
sensations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! that was what I&#8217;d call a close shave,&#8221; whispered the
kneeling Perk as he surveyed those suspicious holes in the badly riddled door,
all on a line with any crouching human figure without.</p>

<p>There could no longer be any doubt as to the warlike intentions of the man
they had at bay, his fighting spirit, first fed during those bloody days and
nights in the Argonne, had burst into flame again and he shed his free and easy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span> character as the
lord of that wonderful palace at Miami to assume the rough and ready type of an
adventure-loving smuggler chief, quick to defy all authority while the red blood
rioted in his veins.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just got to keep him on the jump,&#8221; Jack was saying,
&#8220;so&#8217;s to occupy his attention and keep him from putting a match to
those papers and that priceless account book with its addresses. Here, find a
way to get in a smash or two on the door, like we meant to break
in&#8211;I&#8217;ll slip around and see what can be done at the
window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, I &#8217;member there&#8217;s a log a&#8217;lyin&#8217; right over
there&#8211;why couldn&#8217;t I use that an&#8217; really break
through?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too dangerous, buddy&#8211;he&#8217;d turn that terror of a
machine-gun on and wipe us off the map. Do what I&#8217;m telling you, only keep
back so he can&#8217;t get you when he shoots again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just watch my smoke,&#8221; grunted Perk, stooping to feel around for
some object that could be made available for the purpose of a door knocker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he heard the other saying as he was starting to move off.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a little pile of rocks&#8211;pick up one and toss it on the
roof of the shack&#8211;make him think we&#8217;re climbing up, meaning to break
in that way&#8211;anything to keep <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_224'></a>224</span> him so busy dodging and firing he&#8217;ll have no
time to start that blaze.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perk grasped the main idea, which was to fight for time&#8211;given even half
a chance, he knew his pal would find some way to accomplish the end he had in
view which was to take Kearns a prisoner with enough positive evidence of his
guilt to convict him when placed on trial in a Federal court.</p>

<p>Hastily then did Perk scramble for the rocks mentioned by his
companion&#8211;it was much too dark for him to see where they lay, but he used
his common sense with such signal success that almost immediately he found what
he sought.</p>

<p>To toss up a good-sized rock with such vim that it came down on the roof with
a loud bang was the work of a few seconds. Hardly had the crash sounded than
Perk had another missile on its way and as long as the pile held out he meant to
keep up a continual fusillade that would have the man inside guessing.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE COME-BACK</span></h2>

<p>It was more or less fun for Perk to keep up that bombardment as long as he
had any ammunition left&#8211;the heavy thumps on the roof continued to follow
each other, like blasts in a quarry or an admiral&#8217;s salute when the
&#8220;old man&#8221; took a notion to come aboard.</p>

<p>So, too, would each concussion be followed by a spurt of gunfire from behind
the closed door of the shack showing that Oswald was alive to the situation and
must be enjoying his share in the strange engagement quite as much as the
fun-loving Perk did his part.</p>

<p>If the little rock pile held out and there were enough ammunition belts for
the machine-gun handy, the chances were that the roof of the bungalow would
assume the nature of a sieve and leak when the next heavy rain storm set in.</p>

<p>Perk was fully aroused now, and awake to his part of the
bombardment&#8211;his mind began to figure just what other means lay within his
reach to continue engaging the attention of the rat in the trap after the last
rock had been fired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>Some of them he
knew had rolled off the slightly sloping roof after accomplishing their duty. If
only he could lay hands on them they might be made to serve again but the
darkness would make this problematical. There was that log he had mentioned to
Jack&#8211;with it he fancied he might do something to keep up the feverish
interest in the game and hold Oswald&#8217;s undivided attention.</p>

<p>What added more or less to the thrill he was enjoying was the fact that at
any minute the ready marksman inside might succeed in reaching him with a bullet
fired at some new angle. Jack had told him how Kearns was said to be quite a
wizard at making bullseyes in a flying target either with a pistol or a
rifle.</p>

<p>He was still going heavy although nearing the end of his ammunition, when
something not on the calendar came along, something so unexpected that Perk was
taken quite by surprise. A weighty and metallic object struck him on the head
with such violence that he saw a million stars all at once, as though a myriad
of rockets had exploded simultaneously high in the air.</p>

<p>He went down like a stone, his senses reeling under that frightful impact and
yet half conscious of the fact that some one must have come up behind him in the
darkness and struck him with a heavy weight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>Now he could
feel hands groping about his person as though seeking to find where to follow up
that first blow with another that would effectually wind up his career for
keeps.</p>

<p>Rendered desperate by the nature of his situation Perk threw up both hands
and chancing to come in contact with a human form, closed in with what might
almost be called a death grip&#8211;his one object being to thus hold the unseen
enemy close and prevent him giving a second blow that would be in the nature of
a knockout.</p>

<p>He met with fierce resistance, but no matter how desperately the other
struggled and fought he was unable to break Perk&#8217;s terrible hold, so like
that of a fighting bulldog, once its teeth have closed for keeps.</p>

<p>There the two antagonists rolled to and fro, striving in turn to get on top,
only to be over-turned in rotation. What made it all the more exciting was the
fact that the man in the shack, hearing all those queer noises, must imagine his
enemies were trying to burrow under the door for he kept up frequent furious
bursts of gunfire and at any moment an unlucky roll was apt to bring the
wrestlers within range of the hail of bullets.</p>

<p>One thing favored Perk&#8211;he was by degrees getting over the deadening
sensation following that frightful blow on his head&#8211;apparently the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span> other was weakening in
the same proportion that Perk was gaining strength, showing that he must have
been in anything but prime condition when the tussle started.</p>

<p>It was this potent fact that gave Perk his first inkling as to the identity
of the man with whom he struggled. At first he took it for granted the fellow
was the tall confederate they had noticed with Kearns during the late afternoon,
and who had perhaps been away and returned to the shack just at this interesting
moment to find it in a state of siege.</p>

<p>He had hardly begun to get an inkling as to the true state of affairs when
one of his hands, in seeking to get a firmer hold, chanced to come in contact
with something cold and hard. Then he understood just why his antagonist seemed
to be so handicapped in the scramble&#8211;he could stretch his hands apart only
so far&#8211;they were apparently held fast in some mysterious fashion.</p>

<p>It burst upon Perk like a bomb from a sky chaser&#8211;why, after all this
was an old friend of his, one whom he had only recently been hugging with all
his might and main&#8211;in fact no other than the short confederate of Kearns
whom they had left beside the well but a brief time previously.</p>

<p>In some manner, which was a complete mystery to Perk, he had managed to get
his legs <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span> free from
that binding rope which had been wound around and around his ankles in many
coils and then knotted half a dozen times. Perk found it hard to realize this
puzzling fact, but just the same he knew it must be the truth.</p>

<p>He proceeded to continue his rolling process with additional vim, partly
because he now knew the other could not get a chance to whack him again with
both hands handcuffed&#8211;for that was what had actually occurred and it
proved his first surmise&#8211;that hard metal had come in contact with his
cranium.</p>

<p>Presently it came about that Perk was enabled to clutch the throat of his
antagonist and for the second time close his fingers on his larynx, shutting off
his wind completely and causing history to repeat itself.</p>

<p>The fellow gave up immediately, thus hoping Perk would diminish that
paralyzing grip which the other condescended to do. When this had been carried
through Perk made up his mind not to trust to a rope again&#8211;in the first
place he had no rope and even if this were not the case he had for the time
being lost all confidence in ropes as restraining agents.</p>

<p>He remembered he had a second pair of steel bracelets in one of his pockets,
having fetched two pair along with the idea they might have to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span> include some pal of
Kearns&#8217; before finishing their job.</p>

<p>He quickly had the fellow lying inert and acting as though he did not have
another bit of fight left in him. Managing to pull out the handcuffs, Perk first
tested them for size, and finding he could snap them shut after circling the
ankles of his prisoner he did so with a vim. This would effectually prevent the
man from getting any distance away, since he could move his feet only a few
inches at a time at the best.</p>

<p>Perk struggled to his feet, feeling more or less dizzy. His first natural act
was to put a hand to his head, and feel it gently, in order to ascertain the
character and extent of his injuries. There was a cruel lump on his crown and he
knew blood was streaking his face but on the whole he did not believe he was
very badly hurt&#8211;perhaps after the double beating the other fellow had
received at his hands he was worse off than Perk&#8211;an idea that started the
latter chuckling, even if the act caused him a sudden dart of pain that made him
wince.</p>

<p>Then he remembered what was going on, knowledge of which had been knocked out
of his head by the unexpected fight that had taken place. How about Jack?</p>

<p>He dimly remembered hearing further shots from behind the barrier, although
unable to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span> decide
whether the bullets continued to break through close to the bottom of the door
or otherwise. Could this later fire have been directed at Jack, who had unwisely
exposed himself at the side window?</p>

<p>Perk was strongly tempted to disobey orders and hasten around the corner in
order to learn the worst. If that daredevil inside had hurt his pal he would be
mad enough to find some way of blowing up the shack and the gas-mad ex-soldier
along with it, regardless of consequences. He only waited long enough to run his
swollen hands over the recumbent figure of the man in irons so as to make sure
he could not play the same mean trick a second time. Finding everything fast, he
turned away from the scene of his recent ruction, and hurried around the corner
of the shack, bent on backing up Jack or, in case his pal had been placed out of
the running, to avenge his injuries without delay.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A LAST RESORT</span></h2>

<p>Meanwhile how fared Jack in his share of the attempt to corner the defiant
and persistent law-breaker?</p>

<p>He had crept around the corner after leaving his chum, fully convinced that
some sort of heroic measures must be brought to bear on the ugly situation if
they hoped to succeed.</p>

<p>One thing had already been amply proved&#8211;this was the unmistakable fact
that Oswald Kearns must be having one of his occasional brain sprees, the result
of his wartime gassing when he was apt to tip over his balance and for the time
being imagine himself beset by a myriad of bitter foes whom it was his duty, as
well as privilege, to mow down, regardless of everything. Acting under this
delusion he was doubtless resting under the belief that these were Hun
machine-gun squads secreted in nests in the Argonne and that he was duly
recruited by Heaven to round them up, disseminate their number, and fetch a
goodly bunch into the American lines as prisoners of war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>His readiness to
shatter the door of his own lodge was evidence of his obsession, Jack firmly
believed and from which he deduced the opinion that as long as his equipment
held out he was ready to keep up that hot bombardment under the belief that the
enemy were falling like dead leaves in the frosts of late Fall.</p>

<p>This being the case, Jack understood how exceedingly careful he must be not
to expose even the tip of his nose, since everybody said Oswald was a most
wonderful hand with firearms.</p>

<p>No sooner had he turned the corner of the rock shack than he made a discovery
that gave him some satisfaction. At least the man inside had not considered it
necessary that he extinguish the lamp for there was a certain amount of light
coming from the window&#8211;only tiny lances, showing that some sort of shade
had been drawn down as far as it would come.</p>

<p>So Jack crawled hastily forward, bent on taking a peep if it could be
accomplished without too much risk. Having gained a position directly under the
window, he considered just how he must go about it and so discovered that a
plant of some sort&#8211;perhaps a young orange tree, was growing alongside the
shack.</p>

<p>Taking hold of a sprig, he gently moved it across a portion of the opening
and on finding it attracted no attention from within he next <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span> pushed his head up with
the bunch of green foliage.</p>

<p>This resulted in giving him a quick survey of the interior&#8211;he could see
what had come before his vision on his previous survey but at first he failed to
discover any human presence. The fact gave him a feeling of chagrin, under the
impression that Kearns might in some mysterious way have been able to quit the
rock house without being discovered and that they had been outwitted.</p>

<p>In that brief period of time Jack seemed to glimpse all manner of strange
tunnels leading from the secret retreat of the smuggler to certain exits back in
the pine woods, craftily constructed for just such an emergency as had now come
to pass.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly changed his mind on realizing how next to impossible it
would have been to construct such underground exits when the near presence of
great Okeechobee would make digging quite out of the question, since water must
of necessity seep into any such passage and fill it full.</p>

<p>Jack, looking further, had just managed to discover a leg that was thrust
into view when Perk&#8217;s first rock crashed on the roof, making a terrific
noise. Following this came a burst of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_235'></a>235</span> gunfire with the acrid powder-smoke filling the
room and making seeing next to impossible.</p>

<p>Jack crouched down to do a little thinking as well as listen to the exchange
of compliments between the warring forces&#8211;every loud detonation as a lump
of coquina rock fell on the roof would be followed by its complement of rapid
gunfire, just as though the man at bay was bound to keep up his side of the
battle even if he had to create a shortage in his ammunition supply.</p>

<p>It was fierce work, yet bordering on the ludicrous, Jack told himself,
meanwhile wondering just how long Perk&#8217;s heap of missiles would persist,
also what was bound to happen when the rock pile was gone. Doubtless the
near-demented man inside must be working up to a feverish pitch under the
impression that he was specially designed by Providence to annihilate the whole
German army and open a clear path to an Allied march all the way to Berlin!</p>

<p>Then silence came&#8211;a silence that seemed to brood over the scene of
hostilities as might a sea fog drifting in along the coast and baffling the most
skillful of flyers.</p>

<p>Jack had discovered a stick that was some three feet in length and
remembering an old and often tried trick known to frontiersmen away back in the
Kentucky days of Daniel Boone, he meant to try it out in order to see if the
ammunition <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span> of the
besieged man had run out on him or not&#8211;something that was really essential
he should know before proceeding to extremes and breaking into the fortress that
was holding himself and Perk so persistently at bay.</p>

<p>Removing his leather cap with its dangling earlaps, he perched it on the
point of his stick and proceeded to elevate the contrivance so that it might be
seen by the vigilant eyes within.</p>

<p>The result was all that he could have asked, showing that this venerable
Indian trick was just as workable as in the days of old.</p>

<p>A single shot sounded dully within the shack&#8211;there was a tinkling sound
as if a speeding bullet had bored a hole through a pane of glass and down fell
his helmet. Jack picked it up and chuckled to find he could poke an
investigating finger through a hole that had certainly not been there before.
What great luck his head had not been inside that helmet, he was telling himself
on thus learning the wonderful accuracy of the marksman.</p>

<p>Things were again at a standstill, for as long as the half demented Kearns
was able to make such excellent use of his firearm it would be suicide for
either of them to try and break into the shack.</p>

<p>One thing Jack had managed to discover with that brief peep back of the
friendly bunch of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
orange leaves&#8211;there was a little heap of papers in the fireplace, also the
precious book he yearned to possess&#8211;yes, and he could even make out a
smudge as though a match had been used to start a conflagration but owing to
some puff of contrary air the blaze had fizzled and gone out&#8211;an especially
providential favor in their behalf Jack had told himself.</p>

<p>Still, at any moment now the man with the crooked mind was apt to notice how
his purpose had been baffled. Then he would make a second and possibly more
successful attempt to destroy all incriminating evidence as to his connection
with the smuggling of rum, aliens and precious stones into the country, contrary
to the laws of the land.</p>

<p>What could he do should this crisis come upon him, Jack was asking himself as
he crouched there and counted the minutes passing by? There was only one means
for counteracting such a move on the part of the enemy and Jack had already
convinced himself the occasion was fully ripe for it to be tried out.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion the same thing had handily proved its efficacy, so why
not again? Desperate cases require desperate remedies, he kept telling himself
as he groped in his pocket and extracted some small object therefrom, holding it
tightly clinched while he again moved the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_238'></a>238</span> orange leaves across the lower part of the window
without extracting a shot from the guardian of the shack.</p>

<p>Then he nerved himself to take a look and received a shock for he was just in
time to see Kearns down on his knees striking a match which he hastened to apply
to the crumpled papers.</p>

<p>Seeing there was not a second to waste, Jack proceeded to hurl the tear-bomb
he had been holding in his fist straight through the glass, so as to strike
against the stone chimney and be shattered, releasing its powerful contents that
would almost instantly fill the room and blind the man whose fingers held the
burning match.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>FETCHING IN THEIR MAN</span></h2>

<p>There was now no further need for caution.</p>

<p>Jack saw the man inside stagger to his feet, drop his gun and throw both
hands up to his face&#8211;he was starting to rub his eyes as though they had
already commenced to feel the terrible effect of the pungent acid that would
start the tears flowing in streams and render him temporarily blind before he
could exercise his brain sufficiently to unbar the door and rush outside.</p>

<p>But already that tiny blaze on the open hearth was increasing, and would
presently gain such headway as to threaten the utter destruction of the precious
papers that they had come so far and braved all sorts of dangers to get.
Something must be done instantly in order to prevent this threatening
catastrophe.</p>

<p>So Jack, always quick to act, with one smashing blow sent the entire window
sash flying into the room. He did not even stop to learn whether he had cut
himself, but gave an upward spring, gained a precarious knee-hold on the
window-sill and allowed himself to fall inside the room <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span> with its unseen gas contents which
would of necessity act upon his eyes even as it already had done in the case of
his intended prey.</p>

<p>Across to the fireplace went Jack&#8211;he could never tell just how he made
that trip of a dozen feet with his sight already growing dim and his senses
commencing to reel, but he knew that he started to stamp out every atom of those
greedy flames, working like one possessed.</p>

<p>Then he clutched the reeling man by the arm and dragged him across to the
window and bundled him out with as little ceremony as if he had been a sack of
oats.</p>

<p>Blinded himself by this time and hardly knowing what he was doing, Jack
managed to climb through the opening and drop down on top of the writhing figure
on the ground.</p>

<p>Here Perk found them both as he came full tilt around the corner, realizing
something not down on the bills as far as his knowledge went, must have taken
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack&#8211;what&#8217;s happened&#8211;are you bad hurt, buddy?&#8221;
Perk demanded excitedly as he bent down over his chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&#8211;only had to use the tear-gas again&#8211;be better
right off&#8211;don&#8217;t let Kearns get away on your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot ziggetty! you jest bet I won&#8217;t old hoss!&#8221; whooped the
delighted Perk as he squatted <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_241'></a>241</span> alongside the still writhing Oswald, his automatic
held in readiness only waiting for Jack to recover enough to take things in
charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look in the room&#8211;see if the papers are safe&#8211;in the
fireplace&#8211;he started to burn the whole batch and beat us to the
scratch&#8211;had to give him the whole works to save &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus enlightened, Perk stood up and took a look then burst out in a joyous
shout that would have done credit to any cow-puncher on earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all dandy, Jack&#8211;papers safe an&#8217; we got our man
ditto. Mebbe now I&#8217;ll soon get a chance to treat my tummy to some decent
grub, &#8217;cause my ribs&#8217;re stickin&#8217; to my backbone, I&#8217;m that
empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before long Jack&#8217;s eyes ceased to sting and his vision once more became
almost normal. By then, too, Kearns had come to his senses, with Perk keeping
him subdued by means of prodding a weapon in his ribs.</p>

<p>Jack hunted around and found some rope with which they temporarily bound the
arms and ankles of their prisoner. That accomplished he made haste to secure all
the papers as well as the ledger which Kearns had been so eager to destroy when
realizing that at last his scorn for the minions of the law had reaped its
inevitable result&#8211;the pitcher gone once too often to the well&#8211;and
that his game was up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>&#8220;What
next, Boss?&#8221; Perk was asking, &#8220;mean to kidnap both o&#8217; these
guys Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll make our chances better with one showing a yellow streak
and turning on his employer for State&#8217;s evidence,&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s
quick rejoinder, the idea being quite to Perk&#8217;s liking as he speedily made
manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jumpin&#8217; jimcracks! we c&#8217;n tote the pair right nifty an&#8217;
I&#8217;m meanin&#8217; to see that other guy gets all that&#8217;s comin&#8217;
to him, after that nasty crack on the coco he gimme with them irons. Say Jack,
take a look at my head an&#8217; see if it&#8217;s sound still&#8211;gee whiz!
but it felt like the sky&#8217;d gone an&#8217; dropped down on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack speedily reassured him that although there was a lovely lump on the top
of his head, it was nothing very serious. It was understood that there was not a
minute to waste if they were wise. The Lockheed-Vega might blow in any time and
give them trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get both the prisoners together and Perk, you stand guard
over them while I taxi our boat around here so as to save ourselves the job of
moving them along the trail. Is it all right with you, buddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure is,&#8221; came the ready reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll start a little
chin with our honorable guest here an&#8217; see how he likes the idee o&#8217;
sittin&#8217; up next Mr. Philip Ridgeway o&#8217; the Treasury Department <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span> an&#8217; findin&#8217;
out that this time he&#8217;s in the soup for keeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already the prisoner had recovered his customary nerve for on hearing what
Perk was saying he broke out in a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks a bit serious for me, I own up, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
give you credit for being ace high above all your class, for you&#8217;ve played
a clever game and beat me by a mile. So that was tear-gas you tossed into the
room, was it?&#8211;thought I recognized the smell and I want to tell you, once
that hits a chap&#8217;s eyes and he doesn&#8217;t care if a church steeple
topples down on him, he&#8217;s that paralyzed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack lost no time in starting back to where the ship was hidden and having
negotiated the distance along the perilous trail without running afoul of
anything, he managed to toss the palmetto leaves overboard since there was no
further necessity for camouflage. After coaxing his charge out of the narrow
slip, and once on the open lake, he taxied down to the cove close to the coquina
rock shack.</p>

<p>They managed to lug their prisoners aboard and stowed them away as well as
circumstances permitted. Then Jack gave her the gun and they were off.</p>

<p>Once they found themselves on their way at a three thousand-foot ceiling and
headed almost <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span> due
northwest with Tampa as their goal, Perk slapped his pal on the back and gave
vent to his high spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh how joyful it does seem, partner,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;to
be startin&#8217; on the home stretch with our game played to a finish, the
ducks bagged an&#8217; nigh ready for the spit. Somethin&#8217; to crow about
this time, I guess boy. Mebbe the Big Boss up at Washington ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to be tickled pink when he gets the news an&#8217; knows we&#8217;ve
grabbed Oswald by the heels with evidence aplenty to send him to Atlanta for a
term o&#8217; years. This night flight promises to be the happiest ever for the
pair o&#8217; us. I know I&#8217;m actin&#8217; like a loon, partner, but I jest
can&#8217;t help it&#8211;such bully occasions are too few an&#8217; far between
in our line. An&#8217; now I wonder where we&#8217;ll be sent for the next big
job we tackle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll know all that soon enough Perk,&#8221; he was told by his
comrade. &#8220;We deserve a little rest after this business is cleaned up, then
we&#8217;ll be ready to start out fresh and dandy, no matter if it takes us to
the Wild West this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! why not?&#8221; grunted Perk with the air of one who was utterly
indifferent as to whether he was given a mission that would take him to the
other side of the world, as long as he had at his side the pal whom he loved so
well and the backing of the Government to stand for expenses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_245'></a>245</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked the Mexican border to the
limit, have jest cleaned up the worst smugglin&#8217; bunch along the Florida
coast an&#8217; when the call comes for us to take a fling over the Colorado
canyon, or above the snow capped mountain ranges, it&#8217;ll find us ready
an&#8217; all to the good!&#8221;</p>

<p>Although at the time Perk had not the slightest idea that he was posing as a
prophet, it will be seen that such was the case as the title of the next story
in this series will indicate, it being &#8220;<i>Wings Over the Rockies; or Jack
Ralston&#8217;s New Cloud-Chaser.</i>&#8221;</p>
